TX_SI_DE0_012900_0071(0),"Y-you wish to know who <span style=""italic"">I</> am?
Ah...well...that’s rather...",
TX_SI_DE0_012900_0081(0),"I am...ah, yes, I’m on a journey, I suppose.
My name is...Ria. You may call me Ria.",
TX_SI_DE0_012900_0091(0),"Anyhow, I will not forget your kindness in 
helping a stranger like myself. Thank you 
again.",
TX_SI_DE0_012900_0101(0),"If nothing else, at least my journey has 
shown that there are still some good 
people left in the world.",
TX_SI_DE0_012900_0111(0),"And now I must say farewell. I hope that 
your own travels bring you joy.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0001(0),"Bah! There’s nothing for sale here but 
rubbish anyway. We’ve got better places to 
be.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0011(0),"Everyone who’s anyone knows that 
Tobias’s shop is the only place in town with 
goods worth buyin’.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0021(0),"Come along, lads. Nothing left to do here.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0031(0),"A-aye, Boss!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0001(0),"That bastard Tobias!
Up and disappearing without payin’ us for 
the job!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0011(0),"Word is someone gave him a beatin’ and 
chased him clear out of town.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0021(0),"Hmph, there’s a convenient excuse. Slacker 
never did a hard day’s work in his life. 
Doubt we’ll see him, or our money, ever 
again.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0031(0),"W-wait up, Boss...!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0041(0),"...And what was all that commotion about, 
pray tell?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0051(0),"So Tobias was the one behind all this? He 
set those ne’er-do-wells on me to get my 
business?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0061(0),"I knew he was a no-good slacker, but I 
didn’t think he was fool enough to resort 
to intimidating his fellow merchants!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0071(0),"Well, at least you’ve put an end to that 
nonsense. Thank you, young one.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0081(0),Though I do wish that...,
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0091(0),"Ah, but wishes are as numerous as the 
grains of sand in the desert. I’ll be fine.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0101(0),"You’ve done enough already, friend. More 
than enough for a stranger.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0001(0),Can it be...!?,
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0011(0),Y-you’re...,
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0021(0),"Ungh, my head...",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0031(0),"B-but...you were dead!
They told me you were dead!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0041(0),Why would I...be dead...?,
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0051(0),"You're the one...always doing...dangerous 
things...",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0061(0),"Yes, always getting in trouble...my...",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0071(0),"My... Of course, my brother!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0081(0),"Far be it from this old man to interrupt, 
but what is the meaning of all this?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0091(0),"So that's how it is, eh?
You've only been acting like a 
good-for-nothing lout because you 
thought your dear sister dead?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0101(0),"Heh... Pretty embarrassing, eh?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0111(0),"I’m sorry for all the trouble my silly 
brother has caused.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0121(0),"Go on! You apologize, too!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0131(0),"I-I don't need you to tell me, Layla!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0141(0),"...Sorry 'bout all that, old man.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0151(0),"Hmph, well, you sound sincere enough. I'll 
forgive you, but only if you swear you've 
done making trouble in this town.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0161(0),"You bet he is! Or else he'll have to answer 
to me. And you know how that would go, 
don't you, brother dear?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0171(0),"...O-of course. I give my word. It's the 
straight and narrow from here on out for 
me.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0181(0),"And you... Thank you for reuniting me with 
my sister.",
TX_SI_DE0_012900_0002(0),"She was just pretty, that’s all...
What’s wrong with a man wanting to spend 
the night with a pretty lady?",
TX_SI_DE0_012900_0012(0),"I even felt like I’d seen her somewhere 
before... Though I can’t for the life of me 
say where...",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0002(0),"A-ah, you’re the...
I mean, ah, how may I be of service?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0012(0),"Tobias and I had a proper talking, and I 
decided to put him to work here at the 
shop to make up for what he’s done.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0022(0),"Heck, if he proves himself, I may even 
leave the old place to him someday.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0032(0),"I’m not getting any younger, after all. I’ve 
been looking for somone to carry on for 
me for years now.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0012(0),"Those two insisted on working here for 
me to make up for the trouble they’d 
caused.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0022(0),"Heh. Maybe someday I’ll even be able to 
leave this place in their hands. I wouldn’t 
mind spending my last few years in leisure!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0032(0),"To have an honest job and get paid for our 
labor...my brother and I are fortunate 
indeed.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0042(0),"I’m working myself to the bone to prove 
myself to the old man. And, call me crazy, I 
actually like it! It’s all thanks to you, friend.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0_0052(0),"I can’t tell you how good it is to see the 
boss acting like his old self again!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0(1001),"Damn it all!
What does he think he's doing!?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0(1011),"At this rate, all my plans to take over the 
store will have been for naught!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130B0(1021),"Huh!?
H-how long have you been standing there?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0(1001),"Even if I did lose my memories, well...
I cannot spend the rest of my days 
lamenting that fact.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0(1011),"...Shall I bring you something to drink, 
perhaps?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0(1021),"I won't trouble that store any longer, I 
swear it.
After all, I've got no interest in doing work 
for nothing.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0(1031),"Me and the boss'll be off to Cobbleston 
next!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0(1041),"He says we're gonna use this chance to 
spread our wings and start a new life.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0022(0),"What d'you think you're doing!?
Get out of here! Go home already!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0003(0),"...What?
You got a problem with me?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0013(0),Wh-what!?,
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0023(0),Tobias went and skipped town!?,
TX_SI_DE0_013000_0003(0),It's just no good...,
TX_SI_DE0_013000_0013(0),"No matter how many times I run that lout 
out, he always comes back, like a bad leaf...",
TX_SI_DE0_013000_0023(0),"No one would be that bloody persistent 
without reason. Has someone put him up 
to this...?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0041(0),"Tch.
What? You planning to get in my way?",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0042(0),"I'll be back, old man.
You can count on that.",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0043(0),"W-wait for me, Boss!",
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0044(0),Hrmm...,
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0045(0),"Hah...
Looks like my troubles are not over yet...",
TX_SI_DE0_0130A0_0024(0),.........,
TX_SI_DE0_0130C0_0046(0),"You've been a great friend to me.
I thank you for your help.",

out, he always comes back, like a bad leaf...",
TX_SS_MO2_04600_0000(0),"Blimey, but 'e ain't 'alf trouble.",
TX_SS_MO2_04600_0010(0),"See that hoity-toity nobleman with 'is nose in a

can say to 'im, me bein' a commoner an' all.",
TX_SS_MO2_04600_0030(0),Hic! Leave me awone. I'm not fweeling well.,
TX_SS_MO2_04600_0040(0),"Look, just shove off, awright?",
TX_SS_MO2_04700_0000(0),This tome came from a land across the sea.,
TX_SS_MO2_04700_0010(0),"It appears to describe the lives and customs of 
the people who live there.",
TX_SS_MO2_04700_0020(0),"Sadly, it is written in a script I can make neither 
heads nor tails of... I wonder if anyone can.",
TX_SS_MO2_04700_0030(0),"The old lady who's always looking out at the 
sea dresses right funny.",
TX_SS_MO2_04700_0040(0),"But she knows all kinds of stories, so we 
sometimes go visit to hear her tell one.",
TX_SS_MO2_04700_0050(0),"My favorite stories are about this strange land 
that lies over on the other side o' the ocean.",
TX_SS_MO2_04700_0060(0),"I traveled far and wide across this world, and 
learned many tongues.",
TX_SS_MO2_04700_0070(0),"Not that I ever get a chance to speak them. All 
my knowledge is good for is telling tales to the 
children.",
TX_SS_MO2_04800_0000(0),"Don't call me provincial! Wife of a country squire 
I may be, but I have the high fashion sense of a 
lady of the court.",
TX_SS_MO2_04800_0010(0),"...Or so I like to believe. But it's not easy, being a 
taste-maker.",
TX_SS_MO2_04800_0020(0),"For example, I'm having a most dreadful time 
finding a hat for the upcoming ball.",
TX_SS_MO2_04800_0030(0),"See that merchant bloke there? He supplies all 
the noble houses here about.",
TX_SS_MO2_04800_0040(0),"He just took delivery of rare material that's 
used to make hats for noblefolk. They're all mad 
for 'em this year.",
TX_SS_MO2_04800_0050(0),"The highborn won't settle for anything less than 
the latest fashions. Far too fussy, some might 
say, and I wouldn't deny it.",
TX_SS_MO2_04800_0060(0),"Highborn fashion is as fickle as a cat, and even 
less forgiving.",
TX_SS_MO2_04800_0070(0),"Yet one must court it assiduously, or be 
laughed off the dance floor in disgrace.",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0000(0),"I'm studying the Ventus Dynasty, which 
prospered three centuries afore our time.",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0010(0),"Ventus the Third is my favorite of the kings. He 
was renowned for his drawings and paintings.",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0020(0),"Strange thing is, one day Ventus the Third 
suddenly stopped painting and never touched a 
brush again. It was as if he'd lost his muse.",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0030(0),"A queer mystery, fair to say, and I'm setting 
about to solve it.",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0040(0),"Well be with you, friend. Do you have business 
with me?",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0050(0),"...What business do ye 'ave 'ere? Ye'd best 
scarper afore my temper sours.",

from, but I'll be askin' ye to leave.",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0070(0),"How now, then? Want to hear somethin' curious?",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0080(0),"Rumor is there's a direct descendant of the 
Ventus kings residin' in this very town.",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0090(0),"Can't say I know much about kings, nor history 
for all that. But it'd be a rum thing if true, 
wouldn't you say?",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0100(0),"Have ye ever heard tell of the burial site of the 
Ventus kings?",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0110(0),"Some folk say it lies in the place people call the 
Tomb of Kings.",
TX_SS_MO2_04900_0120(0),"Course, no one I know has actually been there.

with violence!",

us? If you haven't, then clear out.",
TX_SS_MO2_05000_0040(0),"Just between you an' me, the boss wasn't 
always like this.",

just...",
TX_SS_MO2_05000_0070(0),"Huh, who the—!? I mean, ah, can I help you with 
something?",

TX_SS_MO2_05100_0020(0),"Y-yes! In fact, I have up to volume four.",
TX_SS_MO2_05100_0030(0),Good. Then I'll get to work on volume three.,
TX_SS_MO2_05100_0040(0),"In the meantime, could you get started on the 
fourth tome over there?",
TX_SS_MO2_05100_0050(0),"But of course, Dominic.",

eventually drifted to this town.",

Dominic. He's taken me as his apprentice.",
TX_SS_MO2_05100_0100(0),"I can't find work as a scholar. But there's not 
really much I can do otherwise.",

histories of the land. But we're still lacking 
information on certain places...",

enough work from Dominic to keep me busy 
for days...",

Cliftlands.",
TX_SS_MO2_05100_0170(0),"Oh! A fellow traveler, I see. I'm currently making 
my way through the Woodlands.",
TX_SS_MO2_05100_0180(0),"I've been taking notes on its rich history. It's 
absolutely fascinating!",

TX_SS_MO2_048B0_0010(0),"So you are saying nobility resides not in dresses

heart, I sense the wisdom of your words...",
TX_SS_MO2_048B0_0030(0),"Indeed, now that I think about it, I see that 
perhaps I have been a woman overly interested 
in the surface of things.",
TX_SS_MO2_048B0_0040(0),"Mayhap—and hark now, for this is a clever 
insight—I was a <span style=""italic"">slave</> to the tyranny of fashion?",

TX_SS_MO2_048B0_0060(0),"Yes, yes, yes! An epiphany! It is how we act, not 
how we look, that matters!",

TX_SS_MO2_048B0_0080(0),"You have given me a valuable lesson, fair

TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0000(0),"I understand you are interested in knowing 
more about the Ventus Dynasty.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0010(0),"Aye! Indeed I am, begging your pardon for being 
so bold and all.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0020(0),"But the question's been eating away at 
me—why is it that Ventus the Third suddenly 
stopped painting?",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0030(0),"The answer to that is quite simple. He was 
replaced, you see. By a double.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0040(0),...Pray what?,
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0050(0),"Yes. He loved his art far more than his kingdom, 
so he cast off the crown and gave up his 
throne.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0060(0),"He then spent the rest of his days in obscurity, 
painting to his heart's content.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0070(0),"Crivens, you tell a far-fetched tale—but how do 
you know it?",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0080(0),"Why, because I am his descendant.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0090(0),"Let go! How did...that is to say, why did...?",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0100(0),"Ventus the Third abdicated because he would 
rather be an artist than a king.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0110(0),"He abandoned his realm and his people. It was a 
feckless act—some would even say cowardly.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0120(0),"The high ministers feared unrest and rebellion. 
So they found a double—a selfless man, who in 
body and visage, happened to resemble the 
former king.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0130(0),"In the end, the realm was well-served by the 
adventure. The false king even had a son, who 
ascended the throne upon his father's death.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0140(0),"Well-served? But the realm collapsed in the end, 
leaving nothing but relics and legends.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0150(0),"Just so. But had the real Ventus the Third 
remained on the throne, I warrant the collapse 
would have come all the sooner.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0160(0),"I, too, am an artist, though I work with stone 
and wood rather than paint. I fair understand 
what drove my ancestor to do what he did.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0170(0),"For him and I, the yearning to create is greater 
than the yearning to rule. It is in our blood, you 
might say.",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0180(0),"The tale of Ventus the Third was more 
confounding than I imagined...",
TX_SS_MO2_049A0_0190(0),I thank you for telling it to me.,
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0000(0),"A tomb!? A royal tomb!? But what could have 
befallen there?",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0010(0),"In his later years until his death, Ventus the 
Third worked to better his realm.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0020(0),"Thanks to his reforms, the realm continued to 
prosper under his son's rule.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0030(0),"But after the son died, the realm was torn 
asunder by civil war.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0040(0),"Two brothers fought for the throne—one the 
son of the queen, one the bastard son of the 
king's mistress.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0050(0),"The baseborn brother was the better man, and 
older, too. But only true blood matters, and the 
throne was his brother's.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0060(0),"So the kingdom was first divided, and then 
broken beyond fixing.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0070(0),"I had heard tell of civil war, but I never knew 
that the royal family itself had become divided.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0080(0),"The man who protects the tomb is a 
descendant of the older brother.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0090(0),"In his veins runs the blood of the man who 
brought the Ventus Dynasty to its tragic end...",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0100(0),"So it's a penance of sorts, the way he devotes 
his life to watching over that tomb.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0110(0),"...I thought me well-versed in matters of the 
past, but I fain imagined such an extraordinary 
tale.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0120(0),"I'm going to write the tale down without 
further ado, and deliver the paper to the Royal 
Society.",
TX_SS_MO2_049B0_0130(0),"Thank you, for all you have done.",

anyway. We've got better places to be.",

payin' us for the job!",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0010(0),"Word is someone gave him a beatin' and chased 
him clear out of town.",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0020(0),"Hmph, there's a convenient excuse. Slacker 
never did a hard day's work in his life. Doubt 
we'll see him, or our money, ever again.",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0030(0),"W-wait up, Boss...!",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0040(0),"...And what was all that commotion about, pray 
tell?",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0050(0),"So Tobias was the one behind all this? He set 
those ne'er-do-wells on me to get my business?",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0060(0),"I knew he was a no-good slacker, but I didn't 
think he was fool enough to resort to 
intimidating his fellow merchants!",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0070(0),"Well, at least you've put an end to that 
nonsense. Thank you, young one.",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0080(0),Though I do wish that...,
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0090(0),"Ah, but wishes are as numerous as the grains 
of sand in the desert. I'll be fine.",
TX_SS_MO2_050A0_0100(0),"You've done enough already, friend. More than 
enough for a stranger.",

what is the meaning of all this?",
TX_SS_MO2_050B0_0090(0),"So that's how it is, eh? You've only been acting 
like a good-for-nothing lout because you 
thought your dear sister dead?",
TX_SS_MO2_050B0_0100(0),"Heh... Pretty embarrassing, eh?",
TX_SS_MO2_050B0_0110(0),"I'm sorry for all the trouble my silly brother has

TX_SS_MO2_050B0_0130(0),"I-I don't need you to tell me, Layla!",

TX_SS_MO2_050B0_0150(0),"Hmph, well, you sound sincere enough. I'll 
forgive you, but only if you swear you're done 
making trouble in this town.",
TX_SS_MO2_050B0_0160(0),"You bet he is! Or else he'll have to answer to 
me. And you know how that would go, don't 
you, brother dear?",

realized what would happen to him.",

my place, so good luck to ye.",
TX_SS_CL1_029B0_0000(0),"So how about it? Ye want to take my place in 
the gang?",
TX_SS_CL1_029B0_0010(0),Huh? What's that ye say?,

conference will be a long one, I warrant.",

so old.",
TX_SS_CL1_031A0_0020(0),You're no spring chicken yourself.,

skills just aren't what they used to be.",
TX_SS_CL1_031A0_0040(0),"But it was a struggle to get that far, wasn't it? I 
doubt you could've gone another step.",

You see, I've already won!",
TX_SS_CL1_031A0_0080(0),Gwahaha!,
TX_SS_CL1_031A0_0090(0),My true aim was to get you to see me.,
TX_SS_CL1_031A0_0100(0),"I knew this would be the perfect chance to take 
the Cat's Eye from you. You're never without it, 
after all!",
TX_SS_CL1_031A0_0110(0),You fell right into my trap! Gwahahaha!,

away.",

the north. But they'll recede again soon

safe from any floods for now.",

small amount of curiosity.",

by. Seems that word is spreading...",

don't live 'round here no more.",
TX_SS_RI3_009400_0090(0),I once served in the household of a noble family.,
TX_SS_RI3_009400_0100(0),"...A small home for one feels terribly small and 
cramped in comparison.",
TX_SS_RI3_009400_0110(0),"To be a house guard for highborns, ye've got to 
earn a name for yerself as a man that can be 
trusted.",
TX_SS_RI3_009400_0120(0),"Well, after I failed to protect my master, ye can 
well imagine what my name was worth.",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0000(0),"...I am a maidservant in the employ of Sir 
Cervantes.",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0010(0),"Unfortunately, his lordship has seen fit to leave 
home and go a'wandering in search of 
adventure.",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0020(0),"He spouted some nonsense about being a 
chosen something-or-other, then clanked off in 
the family armor...",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0030(0),"I do wish he had someone to accompany him 
and keep him safe.",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0040(0),"A bloke callin' himself Cervantes just came by, 
clad head to toe in the finest mail...",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0050(0),"What was he up to, you reckon?",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0060(0),"Since he was a wee tot, my son's dreamed of 
travelin' the world in the service of a knight.",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0070(0),"...Says he don't want to be a knight himself. Just 
his squire.",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0080(0),"It's a rum notion for a lad to get into his head. 
But truth be told, he's not fit for anythin' else 
that I can tell...",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0090(0),"Ahoy, traveler! I am the Chosen Knight!",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0100(0),"...Not bad, eh? I mean my salutation. I've been 
practicing, you see.",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0110(0),"Ever since I read a book about knights, I've 
dreamt of becomin' a noble knight's squire.",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0120(0),"Cor, I love knights, don't you? Their fancy armor 
and jaunty plumes atop their heads...",
TX_SS_RI3_009500_0130(0),"All I needs do now is find one in need of a 
squire...",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0000(0),"I promised you coin, and 'ere it is. Now bring us 
the best wheat you got.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0010(0),"Yes, of course.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0020(0),"Well, 'ang me! Look who it is!",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0030(0),"It's me, Reggie! We sent that wretch Werner 
back to 'ell where 'e belongs! Remember?",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0040(0),"Lord Harald an' the rest of us 'ave been tryin' to 
put this place back together.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0050(0),"Even the townsfolk're doin' what they can to 
undo the 'arm Werner did.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0060(0),"And 'is lordship is workin' 'ard enough to put 
the rest of us to shame.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0070(0),"Now it's just a matter of time afore this place is 
back to what it used to be.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0080(0),"Looks like another merchant's made 'is way 
here. One second, mate.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0090(0),...I'll leave the rest to you.,
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0100(0),...,
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0110(0),"Just 'eard that his lordship's been sellin' off his 
own property to fund the restoration.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0120(0),"They said 'e even sold family heirlooms, 
including 'is late mother's necklace.",
TX_SS_RI3_009600_0130(0),"He don't 'ave many mementos from 'is family to 
begin with. I wish 'e could at least keep those...",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0000(0),"...I yield. Ah, what would Master say, to see me 
defeated like this?",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0010(0),"What's that? You know my master? An' he sent 
you to see how my trainin' goes?",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0020(0),"Then my shame's redoubled. He'll be sore 
displeased when he hears of this.",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0030(0),"I thought I was ready for this journey, that I'd 
learned all I could. But I was wrong...",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0040(0),I'm still a fledglin' with much learnin' still to do.,
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0050(0),"Master always taught that I had to be calm an' 
unperturbed, no matter what was happenin'.",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0060(0),"But it's no easy thing to stay serene when 
swords're flashin' afore your eyes.",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0070(0),I couldn't know that 'til I fought a true battle.,
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0080(0),...,
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0090(0),"...Well. I've got no choice, do I?",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0100(0),"I have to return to Master, an' beg him to teach 
me more.",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0110(0),"I've learned a lesson today—that my trainin' is 
just beginnin'.",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A0_0120(0),Now beggin' you pardon...,
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0000(0),"This...this notebook belonged to the Landar 
family!",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0010(0),"Hm-mm, hm-mm... Ah! Here! ""A secret hiding 
place...""",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0020(0),"That must be where the treasure lies. So I was 
right all along!",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0030(0),"I tell near everyone I meet that I'll be a great 
treasure hunter...",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0040(0),"But most folk just laugh. ""Stop the idle dreamin' 
and live in the real world,"" they say.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0050(0),"...But bein' a treasure hunter is all about 
dreamin'. It's in the nature of the trade.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0060(0),"Mayhap it was just a childish fancy that I'd done 
better to forget when I grew to be a man...",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0070(0),"But...I don't see how I could. Might as well tell a 
man to stop lovin'.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0080(0),"Today's the day I leave farmin' behind and 
become the treasure hunter I was meant to be!",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A0_0090(0),"An' it's all thanks to you. We'll meet again, friend, 
out there on the winding roads...",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0000(0),...Ah-hah.,
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0010(0),"So the last lord of the Landars was denounced 
for corruption, an' slain by an arrow when he 
tried to flee...",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0020(0),"By then, the family had fallen into ruin and didn't 
even have the coin t'pay their house guard.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0030(0),"If that's how it all ended, then there's no hidden 
treasure left anywhere, I warrant.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0040(0),"Well, better to know that now than go on 
chasin' after somethin' that don't exist.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0050(0),"A good treasure hunter knows when to give up 
on one chase an' move to the next...",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0060(0),"S'ppose I'll have to stick to the farmin' for a 
while longer, at least.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0070(0),"An' in the between times, I'll keep lookin' for 
stories of other hidden hordes...",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B0_0080(0),"Thanks be to you for bringin' word. I'm most 
grateful!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0000(0),Ungh...,
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0010(0),"Woe is me! The Chosen Knight's adventure has 
ended e'en before it truly commenced!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0020(0),"...I yield. Cut off my head, for that is your right. 
Do with it as you will.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0030(0),"Y-you won't take my head? Oh, well... That's, er, 
rather a relief, actually.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0040(0),"Ah, but my grueling training, my fasting, my 
endless practicing... 'Twas all for naught.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0050(0),"I, the Chosen Knight, was unprepared for this 
quest. That much is clear now.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0060(0),And now only one path remains left to me...,
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0070(0),I shall go home!,
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0080(0),"Yes, yes, 'tis definitely for the best, for this is a 
big and dangerous world!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A0_0090(0),"Forget me, dear stranger, for I am gone with 
the wind and shall return nevermore!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0000(0),"Well be with you, traveler. Do you have 
business with Cervantes, the Chosen Knight?",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0010(0),"Crivens! Y-you're just like one of them knights 
from my storybooks!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0020(0),"Indeed, lad. Quite right.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0030(0),"Beggin' your pardon, Sir Knight, but could I be 
your squire?",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0040(0),"It's always been my dream to serve a gallant 
knight such as yourself, sir, and travel the world.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0050(0),"Ho-ho. This is a fine coincidence, for I, the 
Chosen Knight, am indeed traveling the world.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0060(0),"...Very well. You may accompany me as my 
squire.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0070(0),T-truly!?,
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0080(0),"I have been growing tired of my solitary path of 
late. A journey shared is all the better for it.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0090(0),"Thank you, sir!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0100(0),"Now let us set about, my loyal squire! The 
legend of the Chosen Knight begins today!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B0_0110(0),"Yes, sir, Your Lordship!",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0000(0),I don't believe my eyes! Where did you get that!?,
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0010(0),"Thank you so much, mate.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0020(0),Let's get it to 'is lordship right away!,
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0030(0),"Reggie, what's the matter? ...Oh, and you've 
brought a familiar face with you!",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0040(0),"Lord Harald, we wanted to give you somethin'.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0050(0),!?,
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0060(0),"How did you get this, Reggie? I very clearly 
recall selling it—",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0070(0),Our friend 'ere brought it back for ya.,
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0080(0),"...I wish you would've told us, sir. Nobody wants 
to see you sellin' your precious mementos like 
that.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0090(0),"I understand. But Werner's reign began when my 
father fell from power.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0100(0),"As his son, I have a responsibility to the 
townspeople to atone for that.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0110(0),"Whenever I think of those who lost friends or 
family, an heirloom appears a mere trinket—",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0120(0),"That's enough, sir.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0130(0),Reggie?,
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0140(0),"Everyone 'ere knows how hard you work to 
put this town back together. There ain't no 
doubt about it.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0150(0),"If atonement's what you're aimin' for, you've 
already gone above and beyond it.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0160(0),"This necklace—heirloom or trinket or what 
have you—belongs in your 'ands.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0170(0),"I 'ope it 'elps you as much as you've 'elped the 
lot of us. Now, it's time you stop starin' at the 
past and focus on the future.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0180(0),...,
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0190(0),"You're right, Reggie. I've been so obsessed with 
making amends that I lost sight of what was 
truly important.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0200(0),"This necklace will be both a precious reminder 
of my family, and of this day.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A0_0210(0),Thank you. Both of you.,
TX_SS_RI3_0093A1_0000(0),"The lad's grown stronger than I'd hoped. 
Defeat's a better teacher than victory, to be 
sure.",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A1_0010(0),"'Twas a good thing, him takin' that journey.",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A1_0020(0),"So the question is, how does a warrior stay 
calm an' unperturbed on the battlefield?",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A1_0030(0),"Answer's clear to me now. It takes years of 
trainin' and true belief in your own skills.",
TX_SS_RI3_0093A1_0040(0),"So I'm goin' to keep studyin' under Master 'til I 
become that man.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A1_0000(0),"Oh-ho! My travelin' friend! I was inclined to think 
we'd be meetin' once more!",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A1_0010(0),"There was hidden treasure here that belonged 
to some long-dead noble, but it's mostly all gone.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094A1_0020(0),"Oh, but I'm not disheartened. Many a hunt turns 
out this way—we hunters simply move on to 
the next.",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B1_0000(0),"Farmin' is steady work, an' you can always 
count on the soil. Unlike treasure huntin'...",
TX_SS_RI3_0094B1_0010(0),"I'm thinkin' that instead of bein' a great treasure 
hunter, I'll set about bein' a great farmer instead.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A1_0000(0),"Well be with you, my friend. The Chosen Knight 
has returned home.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A1_0010(0),"Why wander the earth, indeed, when so many 
souls need my services here in this town.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A1_0020(0),"His lordship has returned home, safe and sound. 
I am most relieved.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A1_0030(0),"I believe he has had his fill of adventuring for 
the nonce, heavens be praised.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B1_0000(0),"Of course a knight needs a squire. Especially 
when he is on an adventure!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B1_0010(0),"...I once trod these highways and byways in 
solitude, but no longer.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B1_0020(0),"It's a real honor, knowin' you're of use to 
someone so noble.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B1_0030(0),"Squirin' is my life's work now, an' I'm happy for 
it!",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B1_0040(0),"His lordship saw fit to send a letter. He informs 
me he is traveling in the company of a squire.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B1_0050(0),"A reliable and hardworking lad, it would appear. 
The news is a weight off my mind.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B1_0060(0),"My boy has gone off adventurin' in the service 
of some highborn knight.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095B1_0070(0),"...It was always his dream to be a squire, so I'm 
pleased for him, even if it gets lonely in the 
house now.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A1_0040(0),My boy's given up on his dream of bein' a squire.,
TX_SS_RI3_0095A1_0050(0),But I'm sure he'll find a new one soon enough.,
TX_SS_RI3_0095A1_0060(0),"I realized that bein' a squire might be too much 
for me to handle.",
TX_SS_RI3_0095A1_0070(0),Now I'm tryin' to find a more fittin' job for me.,
TX_SS_RI3_0096A1_0000(0),"The townsfolk what heard his lordship's story 
asked me 'ow they can 'elp the restoration.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A1_0010(0),"Together, we'll get this town back to—no, 
<span style=""italic"">better</> than—the way it was afore.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A1_0020(0),"It brings me great joy to see the smiles 
returning to the people's faces.",
TX_SS_RI3_0096A1_0030(0),"I will do everything in my power to ensure their 
happiness.",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0000(0),"May not look it now, but I was once in charge 
of an entire company of mercenaries.",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0010(0),"But three of my men betrayed me, and 
everything fell apart then. My company, my life...",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0020(0),"And those three turncoats...they're still out 
there somewhere. Walking around free as can 
be, still with the crests they took from me...",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0030(0),"Haven't the coin or the strength to go after 
them myself. If only someone would see justice 
served...",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0040(0),"Stupid piece of sparkle... This crest won't even 
buy me a proper drink 'round here...",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0050(0),"What? You think it means anything, this useless 
thing? Sure, it meant I was a part of something 
once. And what does that mean? Nothing. 
Brotherhood don't fill your belly.",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0060(0),"Oh, I had a name for myself once. I was the 
mercenary who brought down a whole 
company, all on his own.",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0070(0),"I used to belong to a company of mercenaries 
run by a right fool. To him, it was all 
brotherhood and being in it together, and all that 
kind of rot.",
TX_SS_PL2_03800_0080(0),"So yeah, me and my mates decided to bring him 
down. And bring him down we did.",
TX_SS_PL2_03900_0000(0),"We've had a grave robber sneakin' round here 
lately. Can't people just let the dead rest in peace?",
TX_SS_PL2_03900_0010(0),"In my younger days, I'd have given him what 
for. But these old bones don't move like they 
used to, and the scoundrel just keeps running 
away.",
TX_SS_PL2_03900_0020(0),"If only there were some way to bring that no-
good scoundrel to justice...",
TX_SS_PL2_03900_0030(0),That damn old coot! Chasing me off like that...,
TX_SS_PL2_03900_0040(0),"And what d'you want, huh!? Get away from me!",
TX_SS_PL2_03900_0050(0),"There's been a fair bit of trouble with a 
prowling thief. But now...I've got just the thing to 
deal with 'im.",
TX_SS_PL2_04000_0000(0),"Lately I always hear some strange noises from 
the garden at night...",
TX_SS_PL2_04000_0010(0),"I feared it might be a thief, but nothing seems to 
have been stolen. And yet I keep hearing the 
noises...",
TX_SS_PL2_04000_0020(0),"It couldn't be a ghost of some sort, could it...? I 
can't abide by spirits and things!",
TX_SS_PL2_04000_0030(0),"You seen the gardens surrounding that manor 
house there?",
TX_SS_PL2_04000_0040(0),"Such a terrible waste, the way they've let them 
all gone wild... If they'd only just take proper 
care of them—!",
TX_SS_PL2_04000_0050(0),"What is the master of that house thinking, letting 
such fine gardens grow wild and unkempt?",
TX_SS_PL2_04000_0060(0),"You afraid of ghosts? You wouldn't have to be 
if you were prepared like me.",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0000(0),"Ahoy there! Missed us like a landlocked sailor 
misses the sea, didn't ye?",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0010(0),"We be here on official business. Got a delivery 
for you from the cap'n.",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0020(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0030(0),"Took you long enough, didn't it?",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0040(0),"Ain't no controlling the tides, now is there?",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0050(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0060(0),"Research is a battlefield. And in it, we scholars 
are constantly fighting to conquer more 
territory.",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0070(0),"I requested the materials that I need for my 
research from you, to aid me in this war. But it 
seems you fail to realize the urgency of the

your trading company ever again.",

TX_SS_PL2_04100_0100(0),"If it had only been a matter of punctuality, that 
would have been one thing...",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0110(0),"But no. Why don't you go and ask that captain 
of yours for the reason?",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0120(0),...Ye got a problem with the cap'n now?,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0130(0),Indeed. That brute Leon... We know all about him.,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0140(0),"Coming around with that fearsome look on his 
face and demanding that innocent civilians hand 
over their money!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0150(0),Quit yer filthy lies!,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0160(0),"And if you dare deny him, he runs you right 
through with his great poleaxe! To think we 
were doing business with such a villain...",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0170(0),"VILLAIN!? Ye take that back, ye salty sea slugs!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0180(0),"Everyone's heard the news by now. How 
Captain Leon gave up on merchantry and 
returned to his old pirating ways.",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0190(0),The cap'n would never!,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0200(0),That's right! He told us he'd changed his ways!,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0210(0),"Make all the excuses you want! It doesn't 
change the fact that we won't be asking your 
company for so much as another pebble!",

TX_SS_PL2_04100_0250(0),"Hrmph! Yer not refusing to give us yer 
business... We're refusing to <span style=""italic"">take</> yer business!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0260(0),Our pebbles're too good for ye anyway!,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0270(0),Good then!,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0280(0),"Yeah, good then!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0290(0),"...What were those two book-brains goin' on 
about anyway?",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0300(0),The cap'n would never do a thing like that...,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0310(0),"Grrr! Just wonderin' about it won't get us 
nowhere!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0320(0),"Just rememberin' what those two mud-suckin' 
mollusks said ties me innards in knots!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0330(0),"Here we come outta our way to bring 'em the 
things they wanted, and that's how they treat us!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0340(0),"We don't need the custom of crud buckets like 
that!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0350(0),"I won't be fooled. I know the truth. And the 
truth is that Leon is back to stealing money 
from the innocent.",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0360(0),"Unless my eyes were deceiving me, that man 
was surely the infamous Captain Leon.",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0370(0),"Those ignorant ruffians... Belittling hardworking 
scholars like us!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0380(0),This is why I never trust others...,
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0390(0),"Shove off. Don't you know who I am? I ain't got 
time for the likes of you.",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0400(0),"I'm the great pirate, Leon Bastralle! Bahahaha!",
TX_SS_PL2_04100_0410(0),"...What? If you ain't got any money, then I want 
nothing to do with you. Get lost.",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0000(0),"These crests! I'd know them anywhere! They're 
the ones I gave to those scoundrels!",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0010(0),"I used to give these out to all my lads... Made 
them say their oaths over them, pledging their 
loyalty to the company...",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0020(0),"I entrusted these crests to them...as a sign of 
the faith I put in them, as brothers-in-arms...",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0030(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0040(0),"Those scoundrels... They leaked information to 
our enemies, right before a great battle. Told 
'em all our strategy.",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0050(0),"And some of the other lads... They tried to tell 
me. They accused the villains of selling us out, 
but I...I didn't believe it could be true.",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0060(0),"""They're our brothers,"" I said. ""They'd never 
betray us like that.""",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0070(0),"But in the end, I was wrong.",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0080(0),"We lost that battle, because of their villainry.",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0090(0),"So many good, loyal men lost their lives that 
day. And the company...was done for.",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0100(0),"Even those who survived, I'd brought them 
nothing but pain. I must've ruined so many lives 
with my naivety...",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0110(0),"If only I'd been a better judge of character... 
There's never a day I don't think that.",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0120(0),But I'm going to put those regrets to rest now.,
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0130(0),With this...I can finally start moving forward again.,
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0000(0),F-fine! You got me! I give!,
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0010(0),"I'll tell you the whole thing. Yeah, I'm the one 
who they say was messing with the graves in 
the graveyard.",
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0020(0),But...but that's not the whole story...,
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0030(0),"Look. The old man... He's...well, you know, he's 
gettin' on in years.",
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0040(0),"I wanted to help him out, that's all.",
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0050(0),"But he's a stubborn old coot. He gets mad if you 
even suggest that he can't handle everything on 
his own anymore.",
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0060(0),"I was just tryin' to help him out without him 
noticing. And he goes and accuses a person of 
being a grave robber!",
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0070(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0080(0),"...I guess it may've looked fairly shady, though. 
Sorry for burstin' out like that. I got a bit 
worked up, but I feel a bit calmer.",
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0090(0),"Thanks, I guess. I think I know what I need to do 
now.",
TX_SS_PL2_039A0_0100(0),"I've just got to say it. I'll tell the old man I want 
to help him.",
TX_SS_PL2_039B0_0000(0),"What's that you've got there? That's a fine bow 
if I've ever seen one.",
TX_SS_PL2_039B0_0010(0),"Surprised I can handle a weapon? I'll have you 
know I was a fine archer in my day.",
TX_SS_PL2_039B0_0020(0),"Then one day my legs gave out, and that 
was—hm?",
TX_SS_PL2_039B0_0030(0),"Hohoho! Now I see the way of it! Yes, I should 
be able to use this...",
TX_SS_PL2_039B0_0040(0),"That grave robber thinks I can't chase him 
down. When he turns his back to me, I'll just 
take aim, and...",
TX_SS_PL2_039B0_0050(0),"Gahahaha! He'll never know what hit him! I owe 
you one, friend.",
TX_SS_PL2_039B0_0060(0),"That scoundrel won't be disturbing the dead any 
longer. Not on my watch!",
TX_SS_PL2_040A0_0000(0),"What? Simply having this will drive away ghosts? 
That's...genius! How did you find such a thing!?",
TX_SS_PL2_040A0_0010(0),"The proof is in the pudding. Let's give it a try. If 
it works, it'll be the answer to my prayers!",
TX_SS_PL2_040A0_0020(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL2_040A0_0030(0),"This thing is meant to be a charm against evil, 
yes?",
TX_SS_PL2_040A0_0040(0),"I have to admit that it gives me a rather 
unsettling feeling myself...",
TX_SS_PL2_040A0_0050(0),"But then again, perhaps that is what the spirits 
feel, too! That may be why it drives them away!",
TX_SS_PL2_040A0_0060(0),"W-well, I should at least leave it out in the 
garden. To see if it will do its work there.",
TX_SS_PL2_040A0_0070(0),"And because I don't particularly want it in the 
house with me. That's how much it frightens 
me...",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0000(0),Who is that you have with you?,
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0010(0),"Just an old gardener, milord.",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0020(0),"I wanted to come and hear it from the horse's 
mouth. The reason why you've neglected your 
gardens so.",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0030(0),"Oh. The gardens. Yes, they were my father's 
hobby really, not mine. I've no interest in such 
things.",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0040(0),"I haven't really done a thing for them since my 
father passed away.",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0050(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0060(0),"Have you got a turnip for a brain, boy!?",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0070(0),What!?,
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0080(0),"It only takes one glance at this garden to see 
that whoever made it poured his heart and soul 
and blood into it!",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0090(0),"And you say you've ""got no interest"" in it. You 
just let it die.",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0100(0),I...I'm sorry!?,
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0110(0),"Your father is probably sobbing in the afterlife! 
Didn't you care enough for him even to take 
care of it!?",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0120(0),"Oh! Could it... But no... Do you think my father's 
been visiting each night as ghost, all to care for 
the gardens?",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0130(0),"I've been feeling like the gardens looked a bit 
neater again lately than they had been...",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0140(0),"Hmph. He's probably so distraught at seeing his 
life's work ruined that he can't move on, even in 
death!",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0150(0),"I-I'm sorry, Father! I swear to you that I'll care 
for the gardens!",
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0160(0),That's more like it.,
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0170(0),But...I don't know the first thing about gardening...,
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0180(0),Wh-where does one even begin...?,
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0190(0),Fine then. I will teach you.,
TX_SS_PL2_040B0_0200(0),"You will!? Oh, thank you so!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0000(0),...That's the one!,
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0010(0),"Yes, that's him all right. The filthy thief!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0020(0),C-Cap'n...? Say it ain't so...,
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0030(0),"B-but we all swore... We all swore we'd gone 
over to the straight an' narrow...",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0040(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0050(0),Er. Hello.,
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0060(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0070(0),This scallywag's a right fraud!,
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0080(0),What do you mean by that!?,
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0090(0),"He does look an awful lot like the cap'n, I give ye 
that... But ye can't fool us that easy!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0100(0),"Ye rotten rogue! Yeh've been calling yerself 
Cap'n Leon and stealin' off good folk, is that it!?",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0110(0),"What...do you mean? I am the one, the only... The 
pirate captain Leon Bastralle...",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0120(0),"Ye don't know, do ye? Cap'n Leon's piratin' days 
are over!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0130(0),"If yer gonna impersonate someone, at least do 
yer damn research!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0140(0),I... I never knew that...,
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0150(0),"Phew. Well, I feel light as a breeze now that's 
cleared up!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0160(0),"Got that right! It makes me blood boil, seein' 
someone sullyin' the cap'n's good name like that!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0170(0),"I'm...sorry, you two. It seems that we were 
mistaken.",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0180(0),"Yes, quite thoroughly...",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0190(0),"Eh, water under the bridge. Never did like 
apologies. Givin' 'em or takin' 'em.",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0200(0),"That's right. It's that sorry sea snake who's to 
blame here!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0210(0),"We'd be happy to help you swots with procurin' 
your crystals in the future.",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0220(0),"And we would be happy to request the services 
of you bunch of crusty seadogs.",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0230(0),"Thanks to ye, as well, friend.",
TX_SS_PL2_041A0_0240(0),"Yeah, ye were a true aid to us. Trusty as the 
north star!",
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0140(0),You got a problem with me!? Eh!?,
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0150(0),You gotta be kiddin' me!,
TX_SS_PL2_038A0_0160(0),Someone help me! I beg of you!,
TX_SS_PL2_038A1_0000(0),I've thrown away my old resentment.,
TX_SS_PL2_038A1_0010(0),"I'm not looking back any longer. I'll keep my eyes 
on what lies before me, and do whatever I can 
to make the future even a little brighter.",
TX_SS_PL2_039A1_0000(0),"What do you call that!? Put your back into it! You 
might as well lie down in one of these graves, 
you lump!",
TX_SS_PL2_039A1_0010(0),"I know! I'm trying! Damn, this is harder work 
than I thought it'd be...",
TX_SS_PL2_039A1_0020(0),"...But the old man had been doing all this hard 
work by himself till now.",
TX_SS_PL2_039A1_0030(0),"Why aren't your hands moving!? I didn't say you 
could stop yet! There's still plenty for you to 
learn!",
TX_SS_PL2_039A1_0040(0),"Yes, sir... Of course, sir...",
TX_SS_PL2_039A1_0050(0),Heh heh... The kid's got spirit.,
TX_SS_PL2_039A1_0060(0),The old man's a real slave driver!,
TX_SS_PL2_039B1_0000(0),"Gahahaha! You again, is it?",
TX_SS_PL2_039B1_0010(0),"If you're wondering about that grave robber, I 
took care of him.",
TX_SS_PL2_039B1_0020(0),"And I couldn't have done it without that bow 
you brought me. Can't thank you enough, friend!",
TX_SS_PL2_040A1_0000(0),"Oh, it's you again!",
TX_SS_PL2_040A1_0010(0),"It seems that thing you brought did the trick. I 
haven't been hearing all those unsettling noises 
of late.",
TX_SS_PL2_040A1_0020(0),"I suppose even ghosts find it too frightening. I 
can't say I disagree with them!",
TX_SS_PL2_040A1_0030(0),"...There's a horrifying figurine in the gardens of 
that manor house.",
TX_SS_PL2_040A1_0040(0),I can't go anywhere near it. It's terrible to behold!,
TX_SS_PL2_040B1_0000(0),I find that I've quite come to like gardening!,
TX_SS_PL2_040B1_0010(0),"The noises have stopped at night as well. I think 
my father must have forgiven me at last...",
TX_SS_PL2_040B1_0020(0),"...Truth is that those noises the lad used to hear 
at night weren't any ghost. That was me, letting 
myself in to care for the gardens.",
TX_SS_PL2_040B1_0030(0),"But I'd feel too bad revealing that now. We'll 
keep it between you and me, shall we?",
TX_SS_PL2_041A1_0000(0),"We still owe ye for last time, friend!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A1_0010(0),"Thanks again for yer help, matey!",
TX_SS_PL2_041A1_0020(0),"Now that all that nonsense is settled, it's time I 
return to my research.",
TX_SS_PL2_041A1_0030(0),"I should be able to make some good progress. 
After all, I know just who I can count on to get 
me all the materials I should ever need to order 
in.",
TX_SS_PL2_041A1_0040(0),I suppose it's time I delve back into my work.,
TX_SS_PL2_041A1_0050(0),"You're curious about my studies? I'm afraid 
they're not for the likes of you...",
TX_SS_PL2_041A1_0060(0),I-I'm really very sorry...,
TX_SS_PL2_041A1_0070(0),"I only started acting and dressing like Captain 
Leon because he was my hero... I don't know 
where I went wrong...",
TX_SS_PL1_000700_0000(0),"Shall I tell you a secret? Truth is, I've been asked 
to cook for the king himself!",
TX_SS_PL1_000700_0010(0),"I do not lack for confidence in my skills. Alas, I 
can't seem to get my hands on the ingredients I 
need most...",
TX_SS_PL1_000700_0020(0),"I want only the best milk, crab, and eggs.",
TX_SS_PL1_000900_0000(0),"You see that house over there? I haven't seen 
the husband around for some time.",
TX_SS_PL1_000900_0010(0),I wonder where he could be off to...?,
TX_SS_PL1_000900_0020(0),*koff koff*,
TX_SS_PL1_000900_0030(0),"My husband took himself off into the cave of 【★ダンジョン名】 
and never came back...",
TX_SS_PL1_000900_0040(0),"If anything happened to him, I...I couldn't... Oh 
please. Please, let him come back home safe to 
me...",
TX_SS_PL1_000900_0050(0),"What now!? Oh! You're human.. I thought it was 
another monster...",
TX_SS_PL1_000900_0060(0),"I came here to try to find a particular herb that 
only grows in these caves. I need it for my 
wife. But I only ended up losing my way...",
TX_SS_PL1_000900_0070(0),"I must get back to her at once, though... These 
herbs will finally allow her to get better, once 
and for all...",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0000(0),"Something happened to my husband when he 
was away in battle. He's not the same any 
longer...",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0010(0),"He came home once but wouldn't remove any 
of his armor. Then he up and disappeared again 
as sudden as anything.",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0020(0),"What could have happened to have caused such 
a change?",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0030(0),"There's a legend of a cursed set of armor in 
this land that can control the actions of those 
who don it.",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0040(0),"Aye, the greatest arms tried to crack the armor 
in twain, and the clerics tried to purify it with 
holy waters, but not avail.",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0050(0),"No one knows where the armor is now. I hope 
it isn't still out there in the world somewhere, 
controlling some poor soul...",

TX_SS_PL1_001000_0070(0),"My body...moves...without my... ...control! M-
might...might...hurt you!",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0080(0),Rggghhhhhh!,
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0090(0),"You know what my old gran used to always tell 
me?",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0100(0),"She said there was a holy spring that could 
remove any curse. Somewhere on this very 
continent!",
TX_SS_PL1_001000_0110(0),"She even said she knew where it was. Oh, it's 
on the tip of my tongue... Where was it that she 
said...?",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0000(0),"This tome, <span style=""italic"">The</> <span style=""italic"">Ancient</> <span style=""italic"">Capitals</>, contains a

everything is made of gold!",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0020(0),"I wish there were more details about it, but it's 
only the briefest mention...",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0030(0),"The old man who came through not long ago 
said he was a writer.",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0040(0),"Apparently he writes all sorts of books to fund 
his travels.",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0050(0),"He mentioned some title... What was it again? 
<span style=""italic"">The</> <span style=""italic"">Ancient</> <span style=""italic"">Capitals</>, or something like that.",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0060(0),"My son is a true scholar, just like me.",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0070(0),"He's terribly clever. But sometimes he does talk 
such nonsense!",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0080(0),"Recently all he does is mutter about a city made 
of gold. I don't know where he gets these 
fantastical ideas from...",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0090(0),"I'm a wandering writer. I travel the world, 
writing my books as I flit from place to place.",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0100(0),"I just put out a new volume, in fact. Perhaps you 
heard of it? <span style=""italic"">The</> <span style=""italic"">Ancient</> <span style=""italic"">Capitals</>, I called it. It's 
done rather well for itself.",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0110(0),"And even after I had to cut so much material 
from it! Oh, the things I know could fill several 
volumes, not just that paltry one.",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0120(0),"I'm thoroughly occupied recently with studying 
the legends of a certain city.",
TX_SS_PL1_001100_0130(0),Though I don't suppose you would care...,
TX_SS_PL1_001200_0000(0),"I collect great works of art. And this particular 
artist has been a favorite of mine lately.",
TX_SS_PL1_001200_0010(0),"The only trouble I have is that this artist is quite 
particular and refuses to paint anything but 
landscapes.",
TX_SS_PL1_001200_0020(0),"Still, I wish I could find more of his work. If only 
I could track down more examples...",
TX_SS_PL1_001200_0030(0),"My elder brother is an amazing artist. He's 
probably by the river as we speak, painting 
another masterpiece.",
TX_SS_PL1_001200_0040(0),"Alas and alack! The gallery says that my 
paintings have nothing to offer. It would seem 
the people tire of landscapes.",
TX_SS_PL1_001200_0050(0),"So this shall be my last ever painting. I'll never 
make a living with art. It's time I accept that.",

knights. I have been given the honor of guarding

to keep this place safe but also experience true 
battle?",

They've produced some of the greatest knights 
this realm has known.",

eyes. I wonder what could be bothering him?",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A1_0000(0),"My father has recognized me as being worthy 
to carry on our great line! I am to be dubbed as 
a knight at last!",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A1_0010(0),"I'm sure that it is a result of the great battle 
that you allowed me to share with you. I must 
thank you again for that.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A1_0020(0),"And on that note...I have one more favor I must 
beg of you.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A1_0030(0),"Might I ask you for just one more battle, as 
before?",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A1_0040(0),"It seems that little lordling is finally going to 
become a true knight.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A1_0050(0),"That is all any squire dreams of, to be sure. Yet 
he doesn't look quite as pleased as I might have 
expected...",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A1_0060(0),But what he could have to be unhappy about?,
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0000(0),"Oh! Thank you! At last, I can cook a meal truly fit 
for a king!",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0010(0),Behold! My newest specialty: crimson crab pie!,
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0020(0),"Ho! What a scrumptious aroma! Might I have a 
taste?",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0030(0),"Wait, I know you... You're famed throughout the 
realm for your discerning palate! Why, it would 
be my pleasure!",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0040(0),Om nom nom...,
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0050(0),"Why, this is absolutely delicious! Simply sublime!",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0060(0),"The rich and savory taste of the crab melds 
perfectly with the thick, buttery piecrust!",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0070(0),"It's wonderful piping hot, but I have no doubt it 
would be just as tasty served cold, as well!",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0080(0),"But of course! After all, there's no guarantee the 
pie won't cool by the time it reaches the king's 
table.",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0090(0),"I can see you've thought this through! This is a 
dish I'd love to share with my fellow fine dining 
aficionados!",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A0_0100(0),"Why, it would be an honor!",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A0_0000(0),Darling!,
TX_SS_PL1_0009A0_0010(0),"I'm so sorry that it took me so long. But I've 
brought you those herbs. You see? Just like I 
said I would.",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A0_0020(0),You came back to me... That's all I ever needed.,
TX_SS_PL1_0009A0_0030(0),"I've made you worry, haven't I?",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A0_0040(0),"It was only thanks to you that I made it back 
here to my beloved wife.",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A0_0050(0),I don't know how I can thank you...,
TX_SS_PL1_0009A0_0060(0),Please accept my thanks as well.,
TX_SS_PL1_0009A0_0070(0),"Thank you so much for saving my husband for 
me.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0000(0),Aaauuuggghhhhhhh!,
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0010(0),"W-wha...? My body... I can move freely once 
more! Y-you've saved me!",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0020(0),"The moment I donned that armor, everything 
went so terribly wrong...",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0030(0),"On the battlefield, I had cut down my foes 
before I'd even thought to move.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0040(0),"Yet even after the battle had been won, I had no 
desire to shed my armor. Rather I...I wanted to 
cut down ever more people...",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0050(0),"It was all because of this armor, wasn't it?",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0060(0),"Everything will be fine now that I have that 
awful armor off of me. My body is mine own 
again!",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0070(0),"I'm so grateful to you for freeing me from this 
curse.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A0_0080(0),"...I should return to my wife's side at once. I 
fear I've worried her greatly.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0000(0),Aaauuuggghhhhhhh!,
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0010(0),"W-wha...? My body... I can move freely once 
more! Y-you've rescued me!",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0020(0),"Was it the armor that was causing me to feel 
so strangely?",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0030(0),Hrm.........,
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0040(0),"It's true that I was able to wield such great 
power in the battlefield that I did not feel as 
though it were my own.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0050(0),"That power saved my fellow knights on many 
occassions. It saved me as well.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0060(0),I cannot deny that.,
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0070(0),"It is my own fault for letting myself be 
controlled, not the armor's. It should have been 
a blessing, but I was the one failed to use it 
wisely.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0080(0),"...I thank you for opening my eyes. I will not let 
myself be controlled by this armor again.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B0_0090(0),"Instead I will continue to use the strength of this 
armor to my own ends.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0000(0),"Oh! <span style=""italic"">The</> <span style=""italic"">Ancient</> <span style=""italic"">Capitals</>! Have you been 
enjoying my book?",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0010(0),"<span style=""italic"">Your</> book!? You mean to say that you wrote 
this book!?",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0020(0),"Please! Can you tell me anything more about the 
city of gold!?",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0030(0),"The city of gold, eh? Well, it is a tale I first heard 
from my own grandfather.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0040(0),"He said it was a wondrous place, all of glittering 
gold, where none was ever hungry, and there 
was no disease and no old age.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0050(0),"Amazing! So there really is such a utopia in this 
world!",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0060(0),"It's true that the city of gold did exist. But no 
one lived there.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0070(0),What!? But why would that be!?,
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0080(0),"My grandfather shared the same questions. But 
there were no people in that city.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0090(0),"A place where none go hungry or get old or 
grow sick...",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0100(0),"That's easy enough to promise, when no one 
lives there at all.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0110(0),"That is your perfect utopia. An empty place, 
devoid of life.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0120(0),"My grandfather came to the conclusion that 
such was the natural end of human avarice.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0130(0),Human...avarice?,
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0140(0),"Yes. It seems like it turned even their food and 
water to gold. Nothing survived their avarice.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0150(0),"But no matter how much humanity might lust 
for gold and love it, they cannot live off it. They 
cannot eat it.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0160(0),"And so the people were forced to abandon their 
city of gold, and it fell into ruin.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0170(0),"That is what my grandfather thought, anyway. 
But it was no more than a theory, so I did not 
include it in my book.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0180(0),"Is that right? Well...that is most interesting. Thank 
you for sharing the story with me.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0190(0),"Now I find myself wanting to know more about 
why the city of gold fell into ruin as well.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0200(0),"Yes? Well, if you do find any other answers, I 
hope I will someday get to hear them from you.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0210(0),"Yes, certainly.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0220(0),And thank you.,
TX_SS_PL1_0011A0_0230(0),"You didn't have to bring this man to me, but I do 
appreciate it greatly.",

promising!",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0010(0),"There was once a lord, in a distant island nation 
far to the east. And one day he had a dream...",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0020(0),"A voice spoke to him and said, ""I will grant you 
one wish.""",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0030(0),"The lord thought it was the voice of a god. So 
the lord answered without thinking—",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0040(0),"""Make this city into a utopia, where none go 
hungry, where no one ever grows old or ill.""",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0050(0),"His wish was heard and overnight the entire city 
was turned to gold.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0060(0),"And in that city of gold, there were none who 
went hungry, no old age and no illness.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0070(0),Do you hear that? Such a wondrous place...,
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0080(0),"Though it still sounds more like fantasy than 
truth... It has the romantic appeal of a legend, to 
be sure.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0090(0),"Books are such a delight, aren't they? And this 
one is a prime example! I'll have to be sure to 
tell everyone to read it!",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B0_0100(0),"Thank you for helping me learn more about the 
city of gold. I feel so much better now for 
knowing more!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A0_0000(0),"Nonsense! That cannot be! You say my favorite 
artist will never paint again!? This is his final 
painting!?",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A0_0010(0),"How could any with such talent ever abandon 
his art? His paintings are flawless! There is 
nothing anyone could say to criticize such a 
masterpiece!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A0_0020(0),.........,
TX_SS_PL1_0012A0_0030(0),"...I see. Yes, perhaps it is because this was to be 
his last ever piece that it is so exquisite.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A0_0040(0),"He did not merely paint what he saw. He poured 
all his artist's soul into this landscape...",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A0_0050(0),"I believe that this hill must be a place of great 
import to this artist.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A0_0060(0),"His love for this place has made this into an 
indescribable masterpiece.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A0_0070(0),"As a true fan of this artist, I will treasure his last 
and greatest work for the rest of my days.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0000(0),"I have found you at last! So you are the creator 
of my most beloved landscapes!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0010(0),"I...I suppose I am. You have bought a great 
number of my paintings, haven't you?",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0020(0),Of course! I am perhaps your greatest fan!,
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0030(0),"Is that right? Well, that is...well, it's terribly 
flattering.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0040(0),"But I've decided that I must move on from my 
dreams of being an artist.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0050(0),What!? Why!? I demand to know the reason why!,
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0060(0),"I was told that my paintings are stale. Have 
nothing to recommend them.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0070(0),"That's nonsense! How could anyone fail to see 
how wonderful your paintings are!?",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0080(0),"Your paintings stale? Nothing to recommend 
them? They are pure and true, and any who 
would deny that is simply too evilhearted to see 
it!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0090(0),Pure...? Is that really what you think?,
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0100(0),"I do! When I look at the landscapes that you 
paint, I can see just how you feel!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0110(0),"Looking at the landscape as you see it moves 
me deeply. That pure emotion is what makes 
your paintings so formidable!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0120(0),"It's nothing like those flashy pieces of so-called 
art that sacrifice their soul for the sake of 
appearing original. Your art remains true to 
your soul, and it shows.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0130(0),"Sniffle... Thank you... I never thought I would 
hear such praise...",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0140(0),Is that so?,
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0150(0),"Why don't I serve as your patron then? I will 
support you so that you might continue to 
pursue your art.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0160(0),A-are you quite certain!?,
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0170(0),"Of course! I have told you that I am your 
greatest fan!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0180(0),"I beg you to continue making art, for my sake. 
Would you do that for me?",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0190(0),"I-it is an unimaginable honor to even be asked. I 
would be delighted to!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0200(0),Good! That settles it then!,
TX_SS_PL1_0012B0_0210(0),"I must thank you for the part you played in this 
meeting, as well. If it weren't for you, I might 
have lost my favorite artist forever!",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A0_0000(0),Ugh... So I still cannot beat you...,
TX_SS_PL1_0008A0_0010(0),"Real battle is quite different from training... And I 
still have much to learn.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A0_0020(0),"But first, please allow me to express my 
gratitude.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A0_0030(0),"I shall continue to dedicate myself to my own 
improvement, so that I might serve the realm as 
a knight and bring honor to House Starling.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A0_0040(0),"I hope that we might meet again, so I might 
show you my progress.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A2_0000(0),...So I still can't reach your level.,
TX_SS_PL1_0008A2_0010(0),"However! I think that I have grasped what I 
must do to be able to defeat you!",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A2_0020(0),"This defeat shall be different from before. I will 
use this defeat as the foundation from which I 
will build myself up to be even stronger!",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A2_0030(0),"I must thank you, as always.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A2_0040(0),"I shall become a knight that you will one day 
feel proud to say that you battled with!",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A2_0050(0),"And the kind of knight that can uphold the 
honor of the Starling line!",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A1_0000(0),"Welcome, welcome! How about a bite of the pie 
loved by gourmands the land over?",
TX_SS_PL1_0007A1_0010(0),"That's right! It's the famous crimson crab pie, 
the pride of our town!",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0001(0),Darling? Would you care for some tea?,
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0011(0),"Gladly, my sweet. Nothing gives me greater joy 
than being safely back at home, able to enjoy 
your tea once again...",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0021(0),"Ah, you again! I remember you, of course. How 
could I forget my savior?",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0031(0),"I'm feeling quite completely recovered as well, 
thanks to the herbs that you helped my 
husband bring back home with him.",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0041(0),"You must try some of my wife's tea before 
you go.",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0051(0),Her tea is quite divine.,
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0000(0),"I'm feeling quite completely recovered, thanks to 
the herbs that you helped my husband bring 
back home with him.",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0010(0),"My wife seems so much recovered that it's like 
seeing a different person entirely! It's all thanks 
to you and those herbs we brought back that 
her illness now seems like nothing more than a 
dark dream.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A1_0020(0),"My husband has promised that he will stay at 
home from now on, no longer leaving me 
behind for the battlefield.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A1_0030(0),"Now I'll never have to spend another night 
wondering if he'll return from battle alive or not.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010A1_0040(0),"I think perhaps I was never truly well-suited to 
battle. I'll choose a life of peace from now on.",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B1_0010(0),I'm glad my husband came back home.,
TX_SS_PL1_0010B1_0020(0),"And he seems somehow more energized than 
he ever did before. Every day, he dedicates 
himself to his training and bettering his skills...",
TX_SS_PL1_0010B1_0030(0),"I am a knight. I will protect the people of this 
land, with the strength to be found in this armor!",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A1_0010(0),"It seems that there are several books that treat 
the city of gold as a myth.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A1_0020(0),"Someday I would like to write my own book 
about the city of gold and have everyone read it!",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A1_0030(0),"What do you think? When writing a book, should 
you write all you know or leave some 
mysteries? I found myself often struggling to 
decide.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011A1_0040(0),"I quite like seeing a reader inspired to find out 
more after reading something that I wrote.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B1_0010(0),"I do love reading, don't you?",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B1_0020(0),"It's such fun to be able to visit in your mind 
places that you have never been to.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B1_0030(0),"I want to know about everything there is to 
know in the world.",
TX_SS_PL1_0011B1_0040(0),"That's why I read any kind of book that I can get 
my hands on!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A1_0010(0),"Ah! Hello again. As you can see, I have moved on 
from my painting days. Now I am making my 
living as a baker.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A1_0020(0),"I have made quite a name for myself by making 
decorative loaves shaped like animals and 
flowers. They have been quite the hit!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A1_0030(0),I think I have finally found my true calling!,
TX_SS_PL1_0012A1_0040(0),"I am doing the best I can to be a help to my 
brother!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A1_0050(0),"Business has been going quite well for me since 
I got that painting.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012A1_0060(0),I think it must truly be my good luck charm.,
TX_SS_PL1_0012A1_0070(0),"It shall be a treasured heirloom of my house, 
and I will pass it down for generations to come.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B1_0010(0),"His landscapes truly are masterful. No matter 
how long I look, I never tire of the sight of them.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B1_0020(0),"Thanks to the generosity of my patron, I no 
longer have to worry about my family. I can 
paint every day and still know that they are 
taken care of!",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B1_0030(0),"I will do my best to create art worthy of my 
patron and any others who might care to look 
upon it.",
TX_SS_PL1_0012B1_0040(0),"My brother seems a lot happier these days, 
now that he can paint lots of pictures.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A3_0000(0),"Ah! So we meet again! I have dedicated myself 
to my training since we last met.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A3_0010(0),"It is thanks to my battles with you that I am able 
to progress as a knight without any doubts.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A3_0020(0),"What you gain from defeat is perhaps even 
more important than what you gain from any 
victory.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A3_0030(0),"It seems that whatever was weighing down that 
lording has been lifted from his shoulders.",
TX_SS_PL1_0008A3_0040(0),"He seems to have made peace with whatever 
was bothering him.",
TX_SS_PL1_0009A1_0020(0),I'm glad to see that couple happy together again.,
TX_SS_PL3_007600_0000(0),"My flock seems bothered by something lately. 
Afraid's more like it, maybe.",
TX_SS_PL3_007600_0010(0),"Might be there's some monster lurking nearby. I 
hope someone'll find it and take care of it 
before it gets any of my sheep, if there is one.",
TX_SS_PL3_007600_0020(0),"I heard the merchants saying that they'd seen a 
horrifying monster around here!",
TX_SS_PL3_007600_0030(0),You should really hear the story from them.,
TX_SS_PL3_007600_0040(0),"Eesh! Even just remembering it still gives me 
goosebumps!",
TX_SS_PL3_007600_0050(0),"I travel a great deal as a merchant, and I've met 
with a fair deal of danger in my time...",
TX_SS_PL3_007600_0060(0),"But never anything like that beast before! I don't 
even want to remember it...",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0000(0),"It's a disgrace, that's what it is! He's raising the 
price to use the mills again!",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0010(0),"But it's not like I've got any choice. Can't mill my 
wheat without a windmill. So what am I 
supposed to do?",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0020(0),Wispermill's mills all belong to me.,
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0030(0),"All you need for the mills to keep running is a 
bit of wind. They're surely one of man's 
greatest inventions.",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0040(0),"All of the mills in Wispermill belong to a man 
named Bryan.",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0050(0),"You want to know where to find Bryan? 
Probably won't find him anywhere in the village.",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0060(0),"He loves his drink, so he'll be off in some town 
big enough to have an alehouse or the like.",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0070(0),"I've heard that Bryan's actually quite the coward, 
though. A few tough words, and all his bravado 
just disappears.",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0080(0),"I've designed a new model of windmill. Not to 
boast, but it's far more efficient than the ones 
we already have.",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0090(0),"Alas! For some reason, nobody's willing to give 
it a try.",
TX_SS_PL3_007700_0100(0),"It could save these people a fortune, but 
everyone's stuck in their old ways. If only I 
could find my first customer, I'm sure my luck 
would change!",
TX_SS_PL3_007600_0070(0),Grrrrrr-rrr!,
TX_SS_PL3_0076A0_0000(0),Wha...what is that? A fang?,
TX_SS_PL3_0076A0_0010(0),"A direwolf's fang, you say!?",
TX_SS_PL3_0076A0_0020(0),"If its fang alone is so large as this, how large 
must the beast itself have been...?",

TX_NO_ALI_000000_0000(0),"– From the Diary of Graham Crossford: Part the First –

Grave tidings reached me as I was passing through Victors Hollow in my travels—my beloved's condition had worsened. I knew my journey must be brought to a swift conclusion, lest I be too late in the end...

I made up my mind to sail across the Verdant Deep. The final ingredient I required was the pinion of an ogre eagle, that most fearsome beast of the sky. They are said to make their home in the Forest of Rubeh, beyond that vast emerald sea.

When I arrived at the harbor, there was only one ship to be found. It was a grand one—no mistaking that—but the captain was none other than Leon Bastralle. I recognized him at once, of course. Who could travel these lands without hearing a tale or ten of that dread pirate captain, the very mention of whose name would set even the bravest sailor's heart pounding and palms sweating?

Yet I found the man himself to be quite different from the one spoken of in legend. Captain Leon Bastralle stood at the helm of a merchant trader, which was preparing to hoist sail at the very moment I came upon it. I told him of my haste and implored that he let me aboard.

""I'm afraid I don't let just anyone board my ship,"" he told me, and I felt as though I were being put to some kind of test. It was clear this was a man who did not easily place his trust in others.

My coinpurse as impoverished as my hopes, I held out the only thing of value I could offer: my journal.

""This is the most valuable of my possessions,"" I explained. ""Within it you will find a record of every region of this vast continent—every town I have visited, and every path I have tread. Surely such knowledge is worth the trouble of having one more body aboard your ship for this voyage.""

After all, what need had I of such a log then? My journey was nearly over. All that remained was to obtain the final ingredient and hasten home to my beloved's side. Captain Leon gave a boisterous laugh and gestured me onto his ship with a grin.

""You'd have me believe the leaves of that old book are more valuable than the leaves in my coffers? You must've had quite the journey. I wouldn't mind hearing about it—as you swab my decks.""

As his ship tossed about the stormy sea, my thoughts drifted ahead of the winds to where my wife awaited me. I could see her face in my mind so clearly that it felt as though it was only minutes ago that we parted, not countless moons. And I prayed that the Flame would guide me back to her while that gentle smile still graced her lips.

""It's almost finished at last, my love. Pray wait for me just a little longer...""

---

I know not what has become of my journal since I parted ways with Captain Leon.
But looking back, I am relieved that it left my hands when it did.
Surely it is better that my final entry ended with some traces of hope, rather than the bitter pain I would eventually find at journey's end...",
TX_NO_BAL_000000_0000(0),"– From the Diary of Graham Crossford: Part the Second –

All hope was lost.
My beloved was gone forever.

I had finally finished the elixir, but it was too late. Mere days too late. My one true love had drawn her last breath just as I was racing back to her side, medicine in hand, and heart filled with renewed hope.

For three days and three nights, I lost myself in tears—a river of tears too deep and raging for me to ford my way across it.

It was after the funeral that the woman found me. Lyblac, she called herself. In the depths of my anguish, my life bereft of all meaning, she asked me a simple question, terrible in its implications.

""Wouldn't you like to see your beloved once more?""

That insidious offer, a mere whisper in the wind, took hold of me. Try as I might, I could not close my ears to it. If it would mean seeing my love even once more, then I would give my very life without regret.

Lyblac spoke of the Gate of Finis, which separates this world from the next. If I could find it, and cast it open, I could bring my beloved back to my side. I had heard the legends before, of course, but for the first time I found myself desperate to believe them. Begging the help of one of Kit's companions, I set out to the southeast. It was a fool's journey, but what else remained to me but a fool's hope...?

On my way, I passed through the village of Clearbrook. There I came across a young boy, stricken with illness and lingering just outside death's door. Convulsions wracked his small frame, and his skin was mottled with a purplish pox. I recognized the symptoms at once. How could I not? It was the same foul malady that stole my beloved from me.

I felt the touch of fate in this meeting. Though I had not been in time to save my true love, I still carried the elixir I had labored so long to create—a remedy that could do nothing for her now. There was no doubt in my mind what I must do. And so I treated the boy with my medicine.

When I looked at the boy's face, finally at peace and in calm repose, I saw my beloved again. And in her gentle eyes, I found forgiveness.

""I hope I can do that, too, someday.""

Such were the boy's words to me, when he was strong enough to speak again. He told me that he wished to follow in my footsteps and become a great apothecary. His words were a reward I never expected. In that moment, I felt as though my journey was perhaps not a fool's one, after all.

I left what remained of the elixir and the rest of my medicines behind with the boy. And I set out once more, turning my feet again to the Gate of Finis.

Little did I know that I was making the greatest mistake of my life...",
TX_NO_GIL_000000_0000(0),"– From the Records of House Ravus –

From the time of my first memories, I recall my father lecturing me on the origins of our house. On what it meant to be the head of House Ravus, and on what it was I must give my life to protect. My father had heard the same from his father, and his father from his father before him.

The house of Ravus is blessed with many treasures—and many who covet them. To one born into the house of Ravus, such things are as natural and given as the blue of the sky above us. We are blessed with great treasures, and it is our duty to protect those treasures from those who would use them for ill. And among all the treasures, there were none greater than the dragonstones.

The dragonstones were bestowed upon the first Lord Ravus by the legendary King Beowulf I of Hornburg, and they have been passed down in our family ever since.

The stones are said to have come from a land far to the east, and they are worth far more than their weight in gold. But that is not where their true value lies. A power sleeps within them, and it makes them valuable beyond mortal comprehension. For the name ""dragonstone"" is no simple fancy—the stones house the power of the great wyrms whose name they bear.

It is said that the great sorcerer Odin Crossford used the power of the dragonstones to seal shut the Gate of Finis. Crossford had campaigned together with King Beowulf and aided him in the founding of Hornburg. My father, when he was still with us, once told me this:

""Power in itself is neither good nor evil. It is the man who wields the blade who decides whether he fights for good or evil.""

That is why King Beowulf entrusted the stones to the man he trusted above all others: the loyal knight who would become the first lord of House Ravus.

Great power can bring about boundless good, or unfathomable evil. It is the duty of our house to keep the dragonstones safe, and protect them from those who would wield them for dark ends.

Yet given enough time, great power will always awaken a hunger in others who would claim it for themselves. Once the dragonstones came to House Ravus, there was no end to those who lusted after them—not to mention our many other riches.

Even kith and kin cannot be trusted to stand against such temptation. Once, a rumor reached my ears that suspicious parties were inquiring into the whereabouts of the stones at the behest of my own relatives. It may be that those who sabotaged the carriage my wife and I were riding in did so at the bidding of my own blood.

Oh, my poor Cordelia. What is to become of you? You are too gentle to ever doubt another. I fear that many will draw near to you, cloaked in the guise of kindness, and seek to deceive you.

Cordelia, I can protect you no longer. No matter how I try to call out, my voice cannot reach you on the other side. Yet this I hope you know: though a time may come when you are betrayed by one you trust, I believe your heart will not falter. You will not lose your faith in people, and this is for the best. For there are those truly worthy of your unwavering trust, and you will find them and keep them close at your side.

I held onto such faith, and I was rewarded with a loyal companion worth a thousand other men. Heathcote has been true to me in all things. Surely such a friend will also appear before you, one worthy of your faith.

And so I beg of you, Cordelia: never stop believing in others, for it is this faith that will save you in the end...",
TX_NO_MAR_000000_0000(0),"– From the Diary of Graham Crossford: Part the Third –

How could I have been so wrong?

All I thought of was bringing my beloved back to the world of the living. When Lyblac told me such a thing could be done, I was all too willing to swallow her pretty words.

The moment that I arrived before the gate, I felt a finger of ice run along my spine. Even if my mind had been too slow to recognize it, my very body was repelled by that gate—or more precisely, by what lay beyond it.

While I struggled to catch my breath, Lyblac sketched out a magic circle on the ground with practiced ease. As she traced each twisted line and rune, her hand never faltered. How many times must she have prepared for this moment in her heart of hearts?

It was at that moment that I realized just how she had longed for this moment—how fiercely she desired to see the dark ritual to completion.

""Only by this ritual may the gate be opened. It will not be pleasant for you, but you must bear it if you wish to see your beloved once more.""

So Lyblac spoke as she led me to the center of the magic circle. As she began the ritual, the first thing I felt was a great pain that struck my entire body at once. It was followed by a strange sensation like nothing I had ever experienced. I felt myself stretching and swelling from the inside out. From the corner of my eye, I saw my own hand changing into something foreign and awful. And then, the fear.

Lyblac watched my transformation with a glow in her eye. It was then I knew this ritual was not intended to open the gate and bring my wife back to me. Yes, I know what truly lies beyond the Gate of Finis. That horror is what Lyblac sought to bring back to our world. And I was to be the vessel.

I would be lying if I said I had no idea this was coming.

My conversations with Lyblac had led me to suspect that this ritual would not work for just anyone. It seemed that she needed my blood—the blood of House Crossford, descended from an ancient line of sorcerers. That is why I must be the one to prevent her plan from succeeding. For if I fail, she will only turn her sights upon my dear Kit.

No...that I cannot allow. So while I realized before the end what Lyblac intended, I continued to accompany her in her aims so that I could see the truth of the ritual for myself—and foil it however I could.

Little did I know that I was dealing with a power far, far beyond any mortal's control or conception.

I felt my own sense of self growing faint and distant, and something else entirely filling me. I resisted it with all that I had, but that presence... To that thing, a being like myself—a fragile human spirit—could be crushed as easily as an insect beneath your heel. Then, just before my mind was completely consumed by the darkness, I saw the smiling faces of my wife and son one last time.

"".........!""

I screamed. The memory of my wife gave me the power to resist at that last critical moment. I imagine Lyblac herself did not think I would ever strike back at her. But I had already grown far stronger than I had been as a man. Even when I only managed to land a single blow to her, it cut her deep. She staggered back, and the ritual was interrupted.

This is my chance! All I need do is cHase after her as she flEes and cut her evil at the root, bRinging everything to an end. That is what I mUst do...but wHy am I...whEre am I gOing? wHy am I...I aM turniNg into soMething else. SomEthing lEss And lEss huMan...

""Hornburg will fall.""

I still remember her smile as she said the words.

It was a score of years ago now, mayhap more. A simple sellsword I was then, when she came to me with a sackful of leaves and dark promise in her eyes.

She knew as well as I did that I had far greater aspirations than selling my sword for coin. But coin would have to be a start, and what a start she offered me. Not only the leaves to free me from another man's employ, but as much as I asked for to invest in my plot and establish the connections I would need. The life I'd always dreamed of was finally in my grasp.

I could use her. I could use her to get all that I'd ever wanted...or so I thought. And so I took the girl up on her offer and began my plot to bring down an entire kingdom.

I would need men if I were to accomplish anything, so I created my own sellsword company. The Black Brotherhood, I called them. I spent three years doing nothing but gathering information on Hornburg. Then, using what I had learned, I began to systematically remove any obstacles that might stand in my path.

I used the girl's connections to make my company of sellswords very much in demand in Hornburg. I took the worst of the lot, those with no scruples and nowhere else to go, and made them out to be bandits and thieves. I set these ""villains"" to attacking the borders of Hornburg—and then my Black Brotherhood would turn them back. It was quite the performance!

Other armies didn't stand a chance at beating us to the site of each battle. The skirmishes all took place far from the heart of Hornburg—we knew ahead of time exactly where they would happen. Since the ""foes"" we faced in those battles were in fact our own men, it was an easy feat to give the appearance of a crushing defeat. Through this farce, the Black Brotherhood won the hearts of the people living in those borderlands.

Ingraining myself with the families of these borderlands, I used their introductions to buy trust among many powerful houses of Hornburg. The tales of the Black Brotherhood had spread throughout the realm by then, and I used that woman's money freely to strengthen my ties to powerful men within Hornburg and without.

Still, King Alfred was well-beloved by his people and his bannermen. It would be no small feat to win their hearts away from him. In which case, things would become much easier if he were simply not in the picture. Hornburg would not last long without the people's love for their liege binding them together. And so my eyes landed upon Erhardt, who held a bitter hatred of the king within him. I had him appointed as a member of the king's own guard, so that he could be in the perfect position to do the deed.

All that remained to be done was to give Erhardt the chance that he was all too eager to seize. Mixing lies and truths, I lit a fire among this strong young warrior I befriended. I could spout any lie, and it would not have mattered. Humans care little for facts—they believe what they want to believe.

In the end, it took me just twelve short years to bring Hornburg to ruin.

After the kingdom fell, I decided the time had come to settle my accounts with that woman. I disbanded my company, having no more need for sellswords, and used the riches I had accumulated to buy myself the lands and status that would see me through my remaining days.

To tell the honest truth, this was not easy. I could have gained even more had I remained at that woman's side. She could provide me with wealth and power beyond any human's wildest dreams.

But to pursue this any further would be madness. Perhaps I was already mad, to serve so long at her beck and call to bring down a kingdom.

She was beautiful—there can be no doubt of that. But did I desire her, even for a moment? No. For within that attractive trapping was evil—pure evil, intent on bringing humanity to ruin. If a man dared touch any part of it, his own flesh would rot and fall away. She was a lethal poison. She was a witch.

And so I cut myself off from her entirely and did not look back.

Funny though, is it not? In the end I could not escape her. She brought about my ruin, as surely as if I had indulged in her poisonous touch. For in the end, just as I felled Hornburg, it was Hornburg's last knight who laid me low...",
TX_NO_SHA_000000_0000(0),"– From the Diary of Lord Geoffrey Azelhart –

I kept my faith. I stayed true to my convictions until the end.

Several years before my death, a shadow fell upon my dear Noblecourt—a shadow known as the Obsidians. They brought with them sweet words and false promises, but I would not lend them my ear.

Once they came to understand that I would not be swayed to their way of thinking, they came after my life time and again.

I would not allow myself to be daunted. I dug deeper into the truth to uncover their intentions, their ties, and the mastermind behind their villainy... And my search eventually led me to learn of the Gate of Finis.

In the end, I was murdered by the men who caught wind of my discoveries. Yet I do not regret my actions. I lived true to the words of my house and did all that I could for the sake of my people.

My sole regret is that I have left Primrose alone to pick up the pieces of this broken life I left behind. My precious daughter should not have to bear such a burden on her shoulders...

Primrose.

You stood before my grave and told me, did you not? That you had lived true to what I had taught you.

You are strong, my daughter. You found your own cause and purpose, and the purpose you found was the continuation of my very own. You carried on in my footsteps and finished what I started.

My dear Primrose... When I think of how much you must have suffered all alone, all I can do is beg you to forgive me. Now the time has come for you to lay down your burden and rest.

It is time you forget about me and find happiness, a happiness of your own this time. For I will always be with you.

TX_NO_THE_000000_0000(0),"– From the Diary of Headmaster Yvon of the Royal Academy –

It was fifteen years ago when I first learned of that tome.

The headmaster's chair was but a dream to me in those days, when my prized student Lucia brought a young woman to me. The woman told me that I was the best suited to the position of headmaster. That there was no knowledge, no position that should be off-limits to a man of my ability.

And so she taught me many things—one being the existence of ancient tomes containing the long-forgotten secrets of old. There are several volumes of forbidden writings in Atlasdam's great libraries, and no eyes but the headmaster's are allowed to look upon them. The tome in question is one of these. It is the last extant tract of the legendary sage known as Salomon, whose name lives on in history though the land of his birth, the Kingdom of Bernstein, has long since been forgotten. Long has it been said that he who can decipher its true meaning will obtain power over even life and death.

""The current headmaster is not worthy of such knowledge. What he lacks in intellect only pales to what he lacks in character. I cannot depend on him. I would depend on you.""

She wished to decipher the secrets of the tome, and share its knowledge with the worthy alone. Thus a great scholar was needed, one who would be able to fully understand the arcane truths within the tome. ""The doddering fool who now serves as headmaster could never do such a thing, but a genius such as you, Yvon? Surely you, of all scholars in the realm, are up to the task!"" Yes, that was how she persuaded me.

It was true that I bore little resemblance to the former headmaster, who was interested in nothing but his studies, and whose only praiseworthy trait was his tenacity in that single-minded pursuit. But I was different. I knew that knowledge was worth its weight in gold, and more critically, my intellect far outstripped his. How could the idiots around me fail to realize this!?

This woman told me that the then-headmaster holding a lofty office he had done so little to deserve was tantamount to sin, and I agreed. When she asked me if I could remove him, I assured her that it would be the simplest of tasks. And so, I had him assassinated just as she wished, leaving not a trace of evidence behind to incriminate myself. Shortly after, I ascended to the headmaster's seat in his place.

I encountered the strange woman only once more after that day. When I reported to her that I had murdered the former headmaster, she flashed a chilling smile and simply replied, ""So you did."" Then she walked away, never again to appear before me. Perhaps removing that man was all she wanted of me after all, I thought.

It was no matter. The tome was in my grasp, and I immediately set myself to uncovering its secrets. All the rumors I had heard were true. It was a work of staggering genius! With Lucia as my assistant, I was able to obtain other rare and ancient texts from that woman, even if I never saw her again. Yes, everything was going just as I had planned, and power beyond the imagination was finally within my reach.

How did it all come to this...!?

Damn that accursed Lucia! Damn that heartless, conniving witch!

How did I not see!? She meant to use me from the very start! I was the one who unlocked the secrets, I who constructed the basic theories of how to effectively control life and death...and as soon as I had done that, she had no more need for me.

That was why she gave me a flawed blood-crystal and led Cyrus right to me, so that she could dispose of me without dirtying her own hands!

You despicable, loathsome, hateful woman! Death has not cooled my fury, but only fueled it to greater heights...

Curse you! Curse you and that unholy witch you brought to my side!

May the deceitful Lucia burn for all eternity!
May the foul witch Lyblac be banished beyond the farthest reaches of hell!",
TX_NO_ULR_000000_0000(0),"– From the Diary of Mattias, Prophet of the Accurst Flame –

Once, I too believed in the teachings of the Sacred Flame.

I led the people in its light as a servant of the church. No one could have doubted that I was anything but a pious believer in those days. And when I look back upon it now, it all seems so painfully foolish.

When was it that I first began to doubt the Flame? Perhaps it was after I met Lyblac...?

But no. That was but the catalyst to what was already growing within me. Even before Lyblac appeared, those feelings had taken root in my heart.

The small village whose church I had been appointed to was destroyed in a conflagration, started by a capricious strike of lightning. The flames spread before we even knew what was happening. Before we knew it, we were engulfed in hellsfire. Countless were lost to the flames, even the innocent young children who I'd loved so dearly. They had committed no sins. They did not deserve to have their flesh seared and their bones turned to ash.

So I prayed to the Flame. I prayed and prayed that their lives would be spared. Fool that I was, even after they were dead and gone, I believed that if I prayed hard enough they might return to us—that a miracle might occur.

And so, I offered up every scrap of faith that I had, until at long last I realized the truth: believing in the Sacred Flame and praying to it would not bring about a miracle. And if my faith could not bring me and those I loved succor in our time of greatest need, then it was worthless.

It did not matter to me if the power I needed was forbidden—I would use that power for the force of good and bring about miracles. That was the true faith to which my eyes were finally open. It was not something I had been tricked into by another. I had reached enlightenment. It was only fitting that such a revelation came to me, the one true Savior.

While Lyblac may not have been responsible for my enlightenment, I am still grateful to her. After all, she is the one who granted me the blessing of a hundred years free from aging. The dark secrets written in that tome can allow a man to cheat death, and I owe her a debt for sharing them with me.

I gained eternal life—or close enough—as a true savior should. I then took it upon myself as my duty to save as many people as I could with the power granted to me. And so I set out to kindle a darker Flame in our realm.

If the Sacred Flame could be weakened, yet more of Galdera's accurst power would seep through the Gate of Finis, and I would be able to claim even greater strength for myself.

I hid myself away from those in the church who wished to stop me. But the long march of time was my ally. It wore away the lives and the memories of any and all who once knew me, until it was as if my face had been washed away like words writ in sand. None who still live would remember me as an apostate to the church.

With enough leaves, all things are possible. Even obtaining a new name is little challenge. And so I worked my way back into the church's graces as the trader Mattias. Even the venerable Archbishop Josef did not suspect me for a moment.

Every step of the way, fate has shown me that I am in the right. I was able to uncover Galdera's altar because I am right. I was able to use a fragment of Galdera's power to bring about a miracle because I am right. I could become the Savior of Wispermill and command its people to do my wishes because I am right.

With Simeon as an ally, I never wanted for money, nor power. The Obsidians served me well, whether they knew it or not. Simeon claimed never to have spoken of me to the others. I know not if he meant to use me as a secret weapon against the others if the need ever arose, or if it was simply that he did not trust me. But it hardly mattered.

After laboring for so many decades, the time had come at last. I had succeeded in debilitating Archbishop Josef with the poison the Obsidians had provided me. It was a beautiful poison—no one would ever suspect it was anything but a natural death. All that remained for me to do was to cast a dark shadow on the heart of Lianna, the next Flamebearer, and the Sacred Flame would soon burn black.

That is what was meant to be.
That is what was about to be.

But no! Damn it all to the farthest reaches of hell! The culmination of all I had worked for was mere inches away, so close I could feel the kiss of the accurst flame! And instead, it was all snatched away, that fire snuffed out to leave me in utter darkness and despair!

I am the Savior!
I was meant to bring Galdera's flame to the world!
Why should I be left in this black hell!?

It is dark here...
The blackness...
It is all-consuming, darker than a thousand starless nights...

Please, someone...
Anyone...
Bring me some light...",

wish I could find t'other one.",

other one is.",

proof that this is a relic from the age of legends!",

soil off and what do I find but a pattern 
rendered in gold!",

too! And this!",
TX_SS_FO3_0100A0_0060(0),"Verily, these are wondrous relics! And no one

TX_SS_FO3_0100A1_0020(0),The days of resting on my laurels are over!,
TX_SS_FO3_0101A1_0000(0),"Greetings to you, friend. The little cub's hale and 
healthy.",
TX_SS_FO3_0101A1_0010(0),"Truth is, I can't say if he's really my old mate 
come back to life...",
TX_SS_FO3_0101A1_0020(0),"But either way, I made a promise to that lad, an' 
I intend to keep it.",
TX_SS_FO3_0101A1_0030(0),I still think about that little tiger cub.,
TX_SS_FO3_0101A1_0040(0),"My boy has become a little older and a little 
wiser.",
TX_SS_FO3_0101A1_0050(0),"Children need lessons like this, if they are to 
grow up well and good.",
TX_SS_FO3_0101B1_0000(0),Heel!,
TX_SS_FO3_0101B1_0010(0),Meow!,
TX_SS_FO3_0101B1_0020(0),"We've become fond of the cub in the time he's 
been with us. It's like having another child in the 
house.",
TX_SS_FO3_0102A1_0000(0),"When I look at this earrin', it's almost like Mum's 
with me again.",
TX_SS_FO3_0102A1_0010(0),"I'm goin' t'be strong an' happy, so Mum don't 
have to worry about me none.",
TX_SS_FO3_0102B1_0000(0),"It is wonderful, living with family again. I'd quite 
forgotten what it was like.",
TX_SS_FO3_0102B1_0010(0),"We are going to be strong and happy, so neither 
Mother nor Father need worry for us.",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0000(0),"I dirtied a noble man's clothing... Wh-what's 
gonna happen to me?",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0010(0),"I was told that my son defiled one of the fine 
young lords' belongings.",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0020(0),"He is demanding that we pay him for the 
damage, even if it forces us out of our own 
home... What are we to do?",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0030(0),"That spoiled little lordling is up to his usual 
tricks, I hear. Bullying those weaker and poorer 
than him.",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0040(0),"He bumped into a child himself, then claimed that 
the child had dirtied his fine clothes... Tch!",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0050(0),"Maybe if he experienced some true misfortune 
and pain for himself, he would think twice about 
making others suffer.",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0060(0),"That dirty little child ruined my clothes! Did you 
see that!?",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0070(0),"I mean, honestly, these are hardly better than 
rags. But they should still pay for the trouble 
they've caused me!",
TX_SS_SE2_004200_0080(0),"I told them they had to pay me damages, even if 
they had to sell their very home to do it! 
Hahaha! You should have seen their faces!",
TX_SS_SE2_004300_0000(0),"Some years back now, our ship went down in a 
bad spot o' weather. Most the crew washed up 
eventually, but no one ever saw the captain 
again...",
TX_SS_SE2_004300_0010(0),"The rest o' the crew gave up long ago, and 
everyone went their separate ways in the end.",
TX_SS_SE2_004300_0020(0),"But I 'aven't stopped believin' that the captain
is still alive out there somewhere.",
TX_SS_SE2_004300_0030(0),"A great man, 'e was. Ye'd know 'im anywhere
by 'is long beard. Should ye ever see such a 
man in your travels, I'd be mighty pleased if ye 
could bring 'im 'ere to me.",
TX_SS_SE2_004300_0040(0),"I washed up on shore here some years back, 
with no memory at all of who I might be or 
even what I was once called.",
TX_SS_SE2_004300_0050(0),"I keep on hoping that someone'll recognize me 
one day and be able to tell me who I am... Surely 
someone must have known me, aye?",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0000(0),"Some of the merchants who service my 
merchantry have been having a spot of trouble 
with bandits.",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0010(0),"If something isn't done about it soon, I may have 
difficulty getting stock in for my customers.",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0020(0),"That won't do at all... Something has to be done 
about these bandits!",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0030(0),"Hah... My caravan was set upon by bandits. They 
took everything!",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0040(0),"If I don't find a safer route to travel than that 
blasted highroad, they're going to put me out of 
business!",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0050(0),"That greedy noble bastard, Drevon... Took half 
my damned profit, he did!",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0060(0),"Sure, he might keep us safe from the soldiers' 
nooses, but...",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0070(0),Urk. What? I didn't say nothing.,
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0080(0),"The highway is easy to walk, that's for sure. But 
that's not all you need in a road sometimes.",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0090(0),"Sometimes it's nice to get off the beaten path 
and have a bit of a stroll somewhere other than 
the highway!",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0100(0),"I'm sure a commoner wouldn't understand, but 
it takes quite a great deal of money to maintain 
the lifestyle that one expects of a noble.",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0110(0),"At times one must even lower oneself to the 
level of common villains... But that's not anything 
you would need to know about either, obviously.",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0120(0),"You beat those bandits, did you? Thank you for 
that. But...",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0130(0),"I'm afraid that it doesn't really change anything. 
Hang one, and another springs right up in his 
place.",
TX_SS_SE2_004400_0140(0),"Putting a real stop to this trouble seems a 
hopeless prospect. Someone must be lending 
them some support from behind the scenes...",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0000(0),"There's a right fearsome beast lurking in the sea 
near here.",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0010(0),"If you dare set out in a boat, it'll come right for 
you. Which means that fishing is out of the 
question.",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0020(0),"My fellow found this huge egg and has been 
taking care of it ever since. He's a fisherman. 
What does he even know of eggs?",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0030(0),"He said he found it in the depths of the place 
they call Captains' Bane. I wonder what it might 
hatch into...",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0040(0),You know who that fellow over there is?,
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0050(0),"He's a famous hunter of sea beasts. Brought 
down dozens of them, if the tales are true.",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0060(0),"I'd say there's gotta be something worth 
defeating in the place they call Captains' Bane. I've 
been in this line of work for a long time. You 
just begin to get a feeling for these things.",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0070(0),"There's a trick to luring out those beasts. Only 
an old hand like me can do it.",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0080(0),"It's no good to take more than you need. That's 
as true on the sea as it is anywhere. The beasts 
we hunt may be our prey, but they're also just 
trying to survive, same as us.",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0090(0),"And it doesn't do at all to go after the eggs or 
the young. There are some things you just don't 
do. You savvy?",
TX_SS_SE2_004500_0100(0),"...And if there ever were such a fool who took 
such an egg or young'un themselves, they'd do 
well to return it back to where they found it.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0000(0),...Y-you dare raise a hand to me!?,
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0010(0),"I'll be telling my father about this! You won't get 
away with this!",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0020(0),"...There is no need to tell me, my son. I saw 
everything.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0030(0),"Father! You saw? Then good! Put this filthy 
commoner to death!",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0040(0),"Silence! That is more than enough from you, 
fool son of mine!",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0050(0),F-Father...,
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0060(0),"This is how you treat with a child? Have you no 
shame! Is that how a peer of the realm should 
behave!?",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0070(0),"...I apologize for the distress my son has 
caused. I will be sure that he learns this lesson 
well.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0080(0),"Come along. We will begin by apologizing to that 
boy and his family.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A0_0090(0),"Y-yes, Father...",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0000(0),"Captain!? Is that really ye, Captain!?",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0010(0),"...Captain? Who... Who are you, lad?",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0020(0),"'Ave ye forgotten me? I sailed under ye 'alf my 
life!",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0030(0),Sailed...? Under me?,
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0040(0),"That's right! On the Blue Wave! Don't ye 
remember at all?",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0050(0),"The Blue...Wave... Y-yes! I think I do recall 
something!",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0060(0),"She was my ship! I was the captain of the Blue 
Wave!",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0070(0),"That's right, sir! I've been searching for ye for 
years!",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0080(0),"I'm sorry, lad... Until this very moment I had no 
idea who I was in the world...",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0090(0),"So that's what 'appened... Then it's no wonder I 
'ad such a hard time finding word of ye.",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0100(0),"I've been waiting 'ere in this town since we lost 
ye, believin' that ye must still be alive 
somewhere.",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0110(0),"I'd never give up the ghost that easy. So what 
d'you say to you, me, and the high seas once 
again?",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0120(0),"Aye aye, sir!",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0130(0),"Once word gets 'round that yer alive and 
mannin' a ship, I'm sure the old crew will all 
come flocking back to ye.",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A0_0140(0),"Ha ha! That sounds a real treat! I wouldn't say 
no to more journeys like we used to have. We 
did have a fine time out there in wide open sea, 
didn't we?",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A0_0000(0),"Mm-hmm... I see! Yes, I bet the bandits don't 
frequent a road like this.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A0_0010(0),"It's only a little bit out of the way. It shouldn't be 
too much of a burden on the merchants either.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A0_0020(0),"I'll start telling all the merchant groups about 
this road. We should be back in business in no 
time!",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A0_0030(0),"You've been a real help here. We've really been 
at our wits' end!",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A0_0040(0),"I can't believe you even found this place... Never 
even knew there was such a road here!",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A0_0050(0),"I suppose it's just like business. Sometimes you 
overlook unexpected opportunities.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0000(0),"You...you knave! Do you have any idea who I 
am!?",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0010(0),"I am a noble! I have resources at my command 
that you cannot even imagine! I even have my 
own troupe of bandits at my comm... Ah.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0020(0),Blast. I did not mean to say that...,
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0030(0),"What's the matter, boss? If you need, I can call 
for some more men.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0040(0),"You fool! I can't be seen with you in front of 
others!",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0050(0),What? But...,
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0060(0),"You there! Knave! You will forget what you 
have seen here today, do you understand me?",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0070(0),"I-I give my word that I will break all ties with 
such villains and leave the merchants in peace 
from now on.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0080(0),"In return, I will expect you to keep to yourself 
what you saw here today. This should help 
persuade you.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0090(0),Come on! We're leaving!,
TX_SS_SE2_0044B0_0100(0),Er...wait for me!,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0000(0),Kshaaahhhhhh!!!,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0010(0),.........,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0020(0),Pee-peeg!,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0030(0),......Krrrrrr.,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0040(0),Peeg-peeg-peeg!,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0050(0),.........,
TX_SS_SE2_0045B0_0000(0),"All right. That should be everything ready. Now 
we just wait for the beast to appear.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B0_0010(0),"That scar on your right eye! So I finally found 
you!",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B0_0020(0),Today is the day I finally get revenge for friends!,
TX_SS_SE2_0045B1_0000(0),"The reason I ever started in this line of work 
was because this beast here killed the crew I 
sailed with.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B1_0010(0),"We were just a fishermen then. But this 
monster took our boat down, and everyone 
else was lost beneath the waves.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B1_0020(0),Only I survived...,
TX_SS_SE2_0045B1_0030(0),"That scar on this one's right eye... I did that 
when I lashed out at him with a harpoon.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B1_0040(0),"I've been hunting for this beast ever since that 
day. I swore I would get my revenge.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B1_0050(0),"Thank you for leading me here. Now my friends 
can finally rest in peace.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B1_0060(0),I owe you a great debt...,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0060(0),...Leave 'em be.,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0070(0),"All that beast wanted was for you to return 
that egg you were holding.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0080(0),Krrr...,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0090(0),Now go.,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0100(0),.........,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0110(0),"We're all just trying to survive in this world, be 
we beast or man. Sometimes we've gotta hunt 
others to survive, sometimes we're the ones 
that get hunted.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0120(0),"But we do it to survive. We don't hunt each 
other out of pleasure.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0130(0),Never take a life when you don't have to.,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0140(0),"Though that lesson can take a mighty long time 
to learn.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0150(0),Krrr...,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A0_0160(0),Krrr!,
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0000(0),That noble that I bumped into came to apologize.,
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0010(0),"I guess I could be more careful walking about, 
too.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0020(0),"It seems that young noble received quite the 
scolding from his lord father.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0030(0),"I suppose that young lord is of that age... Young 
men do have such tempers sometimes.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0040(0),"But I did worry for a time of what was to 
become of us. Thank you so much for what 
you did to set him straight.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0050(0),"My father lectured me from dusk till dawn. I 
think my ears are still ringing!",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0060(0),"I don't know... Can I ever be as righteous as he 
is? It's hard to imagine...",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0070(0),"I do thank you for helping that son of mine 
wake up to some sense at last.",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0080(0),"It seems that he's also realized the error of his 
ways. This has been a good experience for him.",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A1_0000(0),"Nothing has brought me greater joy than 
knowing that I was right all along, and the 
captain was still out there.",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A1_0010(0),"I've been sending messages to all the old 
fellows, and they've all said they want to sail out 
under the captain again!",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A1_0020(0),"I hear the old crew is all getting back together. 
Once everyone gets here, it'll be out to sea 
again for me.",
TX_SS_SE2_0043A1_0030(0),"Afraid of the ship going down again? Me? I don't 
see any point in worrying about a thing before 
it happens. You may just worry for nothing.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A1_0000(0),"Since you taught me about that road, we've 
been working on breaking new paths as well.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A1_0010(0),"People and goods are on the move again. It 
should be good for business and even better 
for prices.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A1_0020(0),"It's been such a lifesaver learning from the 
merchantry that there was a path that could 
give us safe passage.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A1_0030(0),"But that's all I'll say about it. I don't want any 
bandits to overhear us and learn of it!",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A1_0040(0),"Those damn merchants... Where are they 
sneaking around lately? We don't see hide nor 
hair of them on the highway!",
TX_SS_SE2_0044A1_0050(0),"We've been lying in wait for ages but for 
naught. We're the ones who're gonna be outta 
work at this rate...",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B1_0000(0),"So...I suppose that's the end of that. The bandits 
have all dried up and disappeared.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B1_0010(0),"Things have really settled down now. We've 
been able to resume business at its usual clip.",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B1_0020(0),"I feel much safer now that those bandits seem 
to have abandoned the highway here. Instead of 
worrying around them, I can think instead on 
what I might want to stock next!",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B1_0030(0),"I-I'm a completely new man, I think you'll find. So 
not a word of what happened before to 
anyone, yes?",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B1_0040(0),"Boooss... Come on! At least pay up for the work 
we did before!",
TX_SS_SE2_0044B1_0050(0),"Seems like the ones who really got robbed 
ended up being us...",
TX_SS_SE2_0045A1_0000(0),"It seems like the beast has returned to deeper 
waters. It hasn't been attacking anyone, and we 
can finally fish once more.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045A1_0010(0),"I've been bringing in great hauls. Now I can finally 
ask my girl to marry me!",
TX_SS_SE2_0045A1_0020(0),"I wonder whatever happened to that egg my 
fellow found?",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B2_0010(0),Here you are again! Thank you again for before.,
TX_SS_SE2_0045B2_0020(0),I was just raising a glass to my old fallen friends.,
TX_SS_SE2_0045B2_0030(0),"I heard you're the one who brought down that 
great beast.",
TX_SS_SE2_0045B2_0040(0),"Now we can finally get back to fishing without 
fear! Thank you, friend!",
TX_SS_SE2_0042A1_0090(0),"Looks like there are some things even nobles 
can't escape. Like the wrath of a parent!",
TX_SS_SE2_0045A1_0030(0),The young'uns will inherit these seas someday.,
TX_SS_SE2_0045A1_0040(0),"That's why it's important to make sure they 
learn what really matters now. Before the old 
hands like myself are all gone.",
TX_SS_SE1_001300_0000(0),Hahhh... The sea sure is as blue as anything...,
TX_SS_SE1_001300_0010(0),"I haven't reeled in a single fish today. I'm about 
at my wits ends...",
TX_SS_SE1_001300_0020(0),"Have you heard about any good spots for 
fishing lately?",
TX_SS_SE1_001300_0030(0),"Hello, traveler. Lovely weather today, isn't it?",
TX_SS_SE1_001300_0040(0),"I'm sure my old friends out on the sea must be 
having a fine day.",
TX_SS_SE1_001300_0050(0),"My grandfather was a master fisherman once, 
y'know!",
TX_SS_SE1_001300_0060(0),"He sometimes says some odd things, but no 
one else could bring in as many fish as he could.",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0000(0),"N-no, I will <span style=""italic"">not</> give up. I will not! I must not!",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0010(0),"I'm the only one who can make you truly 
happy, Mathilda. You may not know it, but I do!",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0020(0),"No matter how difficult it may seem, I will never 
give up on you and me!",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0030(0),Why can't he seem to understand?,
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0040(0),"The same stubborn fool has proposed to me 
ten times over, you see.",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0050(0),"Every time I turn him down, and every time, he 
runs home, crying all the way.",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0060(0),"What woman in her right mind would want to 
marry such a spineless and fragile man? Not me, 
that's for sure!",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0070(0),"My son's of a fine age to settle down and get 
married, but he hasn't had much luck in love.",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0080(0),"I know he has his heart set on a certain lady, 
but she has refused him again and again.",
TX_SS_SE1_001400_0090(0),"Why, I'm embarrassed to be his mother! When I 
find him, I'll have some words for him, all right!",
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0000(0),Oh? What a surprise it is to meet you here.,
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0010(0),"Pray do not tell anyone of my identity. It would 
not do for anyone to know that the crown 
princess of Atlasdam is abroad like this.",
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0020(0),"The truth is that I came to meet the great 
scholar, Professor Paul. He was my tutor when I 
was a young child, and he is on his way back 
here now.",
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0030(0),"Professor Paul has been traveling around an 
island nation off the mainland, for the sake of 
his research.",
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0040(0),"It's been a decade since he left these shores. But 
today at last, the ship bearing him is due at this 
harbor...",
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0050(0),"Every free hand, to the sea! A great ship has 
foundered in the harbor! To yer boats!",
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0060(0),"We'll need every boat we've got to help the 
people! They won't make it long among those 
waves!",
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0070(0),!?,
TX_SS_SE1_001500_0080(0),"No, it cannot be... Forgive me, but I must go find 
out more!",
TX_SS_SE1_0013A0_0000(0),"Oh! Do you see this!? The fish are practically 
leaping up to be caught!",
TX_SS_SE1_0013A0_0010(0),"I've hardly cast a single time and failed to reel 
something in! I feel like I never even knew there 
were so many fish in the sea!",
TX_SS_SE1_0013A0_0020(0),So this was that old man's secret spot...,
TX_SS_SE1_0013A0_0030(0),"I owe you greatly for telling me about it. I'd 
been about to throw in my rod and have to 
look for some other work, or starve out here 
on the sea.",
TX_SS_SE1_0013A0_0040(0),But now I can carry on!,
TX_SS_SE1_0014A0_0000(0),T-Tony... I never knew you were so strong.,
TX_SS_SE1_0014A0_0010(0),"I even surprised myself, Mathilda.",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A0_0020(0),"But when I thought of you and knew that I was 
battling for our future, I was filled with strength 
such as I've never felt!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A0_0030(0),Tony...,
TX_SS_SE1_0014A0_0040(0),"Mathilda... I would do anything for you. Why, I 
would lay down my very life for your happiness!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A0_0050(0),"And so I ask once more: will you give me your 
hand in marriage?",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A0_0060(0),"Oh, Tony! I never realized your love was so 
strong and true.",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A0_0070(0),Yes...yes...a thousand times yes!,
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0000(0),"I beg of you, Mathilda! Have pity on this poor 
soul...",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0010(0),How many times must I say no!?,
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0020(0),"Enough, Tony!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0030(0),M-Mother!? Whatever are you—,
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0040(0),"The girl isn't interested in you. It's as clear as 
day!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0050(0),"This pathetic display does nothing but bring 
shame to you and our whole family!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0060(0),"You're coming with me, Tony. Clearly you need 
a lesson on how to treat a woman.",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0070(0),"F-forgive me, Mother dearest! I promise I'll be a 
good boy!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B0_0080(0),What a pathetic excuse for a man...,
TX_SS_SE1_0015A0_0000(0),"...It is just as I feared. It appears to have been 
Professor Paul's ship that went down.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A0_0010(0),Professor Paul... Please be all right...,
TX_SS_SE1_0015A0_0020(0),"I never thought the ship I was on would go 
down...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A0_0030(0),"And worst of all...I have no idea where I am any 
longer!",
TX_SS_SE1_0013A1_0000(0),Fishing is an absolute pleasure again!,
TX_SS_SE1_0013A1_0010(0),"I feel like I've really come to understand the fish. 
It's as if I know where they'll go next!",
TX_SS_SE1_0013A1_0020(0),It's a beautiful harmony of man and fish!,
TX_SS_SE1_0013A1_0030(0),"I've had a bit more company lately out on the 
sea. It's been quite a bit of fun, in fact.",
TX_SS_SE1_0013A1_0040(0),"It's been a right long time since I last had anyone 
to talk to out on the water other than the fish 
themselves.",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A1_0000(0),"I shall protect my true love Mathilda now and 
forever! As long as she is by my side, I feel 
unstoppable!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A1_0010(0),"And I feel so safe, knowing Tony loves me so. 
I'm sorry I ever doubted his convictions!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A1_0020(0),"It seems my son has finally settled down with a 
woman he loves. It's a relief for me as a 
mother, that's for sure.",
TX_SS_SE1_0014A1_0030(0),"I don't know when he grew to be such a strong 
young man.",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B1_0000(0),"Guhhh... Please, Mother... I never meant to 
bother anyone!",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B1_0010(0),"Did I truly raise him to be such a weak young 
man?",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B1_0020(0),"It seems as though I've still got much to teach 
him.",
TX_SS_SE1_0014B1_0030(0),"I don't even want to think about marriage or 
settling down with anyone for a long time yet!",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0000(0),Professor Paul!,
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0010(0),Yes? Who might you... No... Your Highness!?,
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0020(0),"Yes, it is me! Mary! I am so relieved to find you 
alive and well!",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0030(0),"What a shock! My goodness, I should hardly 
have recognized you!",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0040(0),"Even in my dreams, I could not have imagined 
you would grow into such a fine lady!",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0050(0),"Not the wild little princess that I knew, using 
broken branches as play swords as she ran 
unchecked about the royal gardens.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0060(0),"P-please, sir! Let us keep tales of the past in the 
past, if you please!",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0070(0),"I have never felt more keenly the ten years that 
have passed since I left this continent until this 
moment. Such a long time it does feel like now!",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0080(0),"I wonder if you still recall, Professor, a certain 
event... When I lost you one of your precious 
books...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0090(0),Of course I remember it.,
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0100(0),I had only meant to play a prank.,
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0110(0),"I had hidden that precious tome of yours in one 
of the palace's chimneys...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0120(0),"Hahaha! And what misfortune it was that it 
should have been on the very day that the 
chimney sweeps came to do their duty!",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0130(0),"It was spring and so I hadn't thought there was 
any chance that anyone would set a fire. And 
still, the book ended up so awfully coated with 
soot that it could never be read again...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0140(0),"But when I tried to apologize to you, you told 
me this...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0150(0),"""If you regret your actions, then there is no 
need for me to scold you further.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0160(0),"""But I hope you will promise me two things. The 
first, that you will never do such a thing again...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0170(0),"""And the second...that you will take this empty 
tome and fill it with your own words.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0180(0),"""Write down all that you learn from this day 
onward. And when you have filled this entire 
volume, return it to me.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0190(0),"""I look forward to the day when I will get to 
read about all that you will learn in life, my 
princess.""",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0200(0),"I still remember every word of that 
conversation as though it were only yesterday.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0210(0),"Yet it was more than ten years ago now... How 
the time does fly...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0220(0),"I have kept both of my promises, Professor 
Paul. And this belongs to you...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0230(0),This book! So you truly did complete it?,
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0240(0),"...You have learned a great deal in these ten 
years. Now I understand very well the grace 
and wisdom in your eyes.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0250(0),"And looking at the worn pages of this volume, I 
can tell exactly how hard it is that you've been 
working all this time.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0260(0),"Everything that I am today is thanks to the 
wonderful tutors I have had—like you, 
Professor Paul.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0270(0),"I owe you my eternal gratitude for saving the 
professor.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0280(0),"I am so glad that I was able to see my promise 
fulfilled...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0290(0),"Lately I've been learning from Professor Paul 
about the political systems he has observed in 
other lands.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0300(0),"Someday I will be queen and must dedicate my 
life to the betterment of my people...",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0310(0),"That is why I will never stop trying to learn all I 
can to prepare myself to support my people.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0320(0),"Princess Mary's passion for study puts even an 
old scholar like me to shame.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0330(0),"I have no doubt she will be a great queen 
someday.",
TX_SS_SE1_0015A1_0340(0),"I greatly look forward to seeing the day when 
that happens.",
TX_SS_SE3_007900_0000(0),"I'm very sorry, but we're not yet open for 
business. Oh, you're wondering what it is we do 
here? We are a traveling tavern, of sorts. We 
bring the drink to you.",
TX_SS_SE3_007900_0010(0),"Hmm. I wonder what sort of drink fishermen 
would like best?",
TX_SS_SE3_007900_0020(0),"If you'd like to be a help to me, why don't you 
go ask a handful of fishermen what they prefer. 
Three should do the trick.",
TX_SS_SE3_007900_0030(0),"Drink! Oh yes! A stiff drink is what keeps us 
fishermen upright and out of the sea!",
TX_SS_SE3_007900_0040(0),"I'm pretty particular about my drinks. I won't 
take a sip if it's something I don't like.",
TX_SS_SE3_007900_0050(0),"There's actually this one drink I've been wanting 
to try...",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0000(0),"I hope you're chronicling your days. A diary is a 
record of all you hold in your heart, you know.",

seventy years. I've got enough volumes to fill a 
whole library by now!",

days, of course...",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0030(0),"Is there still anything for an old man to 
experience so thrilling that it demands to be 
recorded in a diary?",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0040(0),I've dedicated my life to collecting.,
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0050(0),"There's nothing that brings as much pleasure in 
life, young one, than obtaining a rare treasure 
that no one else has.",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0060(0),"Heh heh. Do you want to see my collection? It'll 
be the experience of a lifetime. You'll want to 
record it for posterity!",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0070(0),"Greetings. Why, you're in luck today! This might 
just be the luckiest day of your life!",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0080(0),"I've just gotten in something really rare today. 
Something you almost never see.",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0090(0),"This'll be the day you'll want to remember the 
rest of your life. You'll want to write every 
detail down and record it for posterity!",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0100(0),"Hehehe... Are you the type who can keep a 
secret?",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0110(0),"Don't tell anyone else, but...I've got something 
amazing. Something you wouldn't even believe.",
TX_SS_SE3_008000_0120(0),"When I got it, I couldn't help but write it all down 
in my diary. I wouldn't want to ever forget an 
instant of that glorious moment!",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0000(0),"I come from a land so far south of here that 
you will not find it on any map.",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0010(0),"I haven't been back there in a dozen years or 
more. I have no interest in going back by now, 
either.",

of the quatrait blooms that grow there...",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0030(0),"The plants that grow in southern lands produce 
fine spices to use for cooking.",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0040(0),"Even the most flavorless dishes can be imbued 
with the flavorful tastes of the southern lands. 
They are wondrous spices!",

caravan.",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0060(0),"This place is lively, to be sure. A bit <span style=""italic"">too</> lively 
for my tastes.",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0070(0),"It just makes me want to go somewhere far, 
far away...",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0080(0),"Do you know the merchant who brings spices 
from the south?",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0090(0),"The last time I met him, I got the best pepper 
and quatrait, too...",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0100(0),"That caravan there is headed south, from what I 
hear.",
TX_SS_SE3_008100_0110(0),"I've heard there's a village far to the south 
where you can get the best quatrait flowers...",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0000(0),"I was the winning bidder on a painting by the 
famous artist Bastian...",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0010(0),"But this... It's a fake! I bid on it in good faith, 
trusting the man who put it up for auction!",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0020(0),"All of my fortune, gone in a flash. What in the 
world am I to do?",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0030(0),"Heh heh. I have the finest tastes imaginable, 
unlike a mere commoner like you.",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0040(0),"This piece is titled ""Mithello's Widow.""",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0050(0),"It is one of the great masterpieces of our age, 
depicting the sorrow of the woman feels at the 
loss of her husband.",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0060(0),"Her sad eyes have done in many a collector 
over the years, oh yes!",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0070(0),"Ah. But someone like you of course couldn't 
imagine how much a painting like this costs. 
Hahaha!",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0080(0),My husband is a professional art collector.,
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0090(0),"But I have to admit that it all looks worthless to 
me. Not that I can tell him that...",

me. Not that I can tell him that...",

sense as they do money to burn.",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0120(0),"I suppose it's like they say. A fool and his 
money are soon parted!",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0130(0),"Do they even understand what it is they bought 
in that picture?",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0140(0),"This one friend of mine seems to be doing quite 
well for himself lately, though I'm not sure how...",
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0150(0),His paintings never used to sell...,
TX_SS_SE3_008200_0160(0),"He couldn't be doing anything underhanded, 
could he? Like...I don't know...making counterfeits 
of famous paintings or something?",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0000(0),"There is sword up for sale in the auction house 
that belonged to an old brother-in-arms...",

war in the east. I would know his sword 
anywhere.",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0020(0),"Could it be that something happened to him, to 
have parted him with his blade...?",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0030(0),"Hic! Don't think you can just walk up an' talk to 
me. I used to be a knight, y'know!",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0040(0),"What? You wanna know what kinda knight 
doesn't have sword? The kind that had sell it for 
coin, that's who!",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0050(0),Hehehehe. You wanna hear my tales of bravery?,
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0060(0),"I'm not in a line of work that people tend to 
have much praise for. Just warning you now.",

he he... Well, I have my ways...",

they all look very well used, if you get my 
meaning.",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0090(0),"Plenty of his blades look unlike anything you'd 
find in these parts. Where does he find them all?",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0100(0),"Ah. But I do hear that they sell all kinds of things 
in Grandport.",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0110(0),"That old man always tells the same old story 
whenever he has a bit of drink in him.",
TX_SS_SE3_008300_0120(0),"All about how he was a knight once and fought 
in the great war in the east... Do you reckon it's 
true?",
TX_SS_SE3_008400_0000(0),"Oh, Noa... I do hope you're all right...",
TX_SS_SE3_008400_0010(0),"She has never left my letters unanswered for 
so long before...",
TX_SS_SE3_008400_0020(0),"I didn't know what else to do with myself so I 
came here...",
TX_SS_SE3_008400_0030(0),I do hope that nothing is the matter.,
TX_SS_SE3_008400_0040(0),"Noa and I happened to become acquainted when 
I summered in this town once.",
TX_SS_SE3_008400_0050(0),"We spoke of everything and nothing. It was all 
nonsense, really, but she listened to my every 
story with such delight.",

own lands, she begged me to write to her.",

recently, I've had no replies from her...",

her. No, I couldn't bear the thought!",

that's the case, I'll just have you leave your 
things as you go.",

giving up your belongings. I'm afraid that's just 
the way things are.",

we've probably seized more than a few in our

TX_SS_SE3_0079A0_0050(0),"Well, if they're asking for it... Then a bottle of 
Beach Tequila ought to do the trick!",

the glittering blue sea.""",
TX_SS_SE3_0079A0_0070(0),"This one sounds like someone I'd like to drink

what to get!",

that I'd expect any less from such seasoned 
men of the sea!",

worth finding the drinks that'll best please 'em.",

have seen countless paintings in my day.",

that sword where he got it from?",

on opposing sides and we faced one another as 
enemies.",

grew...",

TX_SS_SE3_0083A0_0130(0),...Thank you for telling me of his end.,
TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0000(0),Hic! A drink... Someone bring me a drink...,

met since the war ended.",

mumbling to himself alone in an tavern?",
TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0070(0),.........,
TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0080(0),"After the war...I thought I'd die in battle. I lost all 
desire to wield a blade before that happened.",
TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0090(0),...I saw your sword. Put up on the auction block.,
TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0100(0),Yeah. I sold it. And bought drink instead.,
TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0110(0),"Drink is good... It washes away all the evils 
you've done...",
TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0120(0),.........,
TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0130(0),"You disappoint me, my old friend. Fine then. Find 
comfort in your drink until it does in what little 
of you is left.",

TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0150(0),Already dead!?,

TX_SS_SE3_0083B0_0200(0),Hmph...,
TX_SS_SE3_0084A0_0000(0),"So Noa's letters did not reach me because those 
mountain bandits had robbed the mail carrier...",

distress, I'm so glad you're here!",

embarrassing thing in front of others!",

you, Cordelia. The thought is mortifying!",

another counterfeit.",

very skilled despite her young age.",

we should abandon the idea, after all...",

acting! Nothing is quite like the experience of live 
theater!",

king, he would better see the value of such a 
production...",
TX_SS_DE3_009200_0110(0),"The theater holds endless possibility. It cannot 
be contained in a building of wood and stone!",
TX_SS_DE3_009200_0120(0),"As grand as our own stage is, I know that we 
are destined for an even greater stage than this. 
Someday, I hope we will get to perform our art 
for the pleasure of all.",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0000(0),"Oh? You're the one they say is so good? Let's 
have it then. Show us your skill.",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0010(0),Why don't you do my hair up to prove yourself.,
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0020(0),Certainly. I would be happy to.,
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0030(0),Wha... What is this magic!? Is that truly me!?,
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0040(0),"I look like an entirely different person! I never 
dreamed that one's hair alone could effect such 
a transformation!",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0050(0),"...And so do you like it? Do you approve of my 
ability?",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0060(0),"Of course I do! You must come to work at the 
palace without delay!",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0070(0),Oh!,
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0080(0),I would be delighted to! Thank you very much!,
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0090(0),"You did better than I ever dreamed. I never 
thought you would find us someone so fine.",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0100(0),"You must let me thank you. Truly, we are in 
your debt.",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A0_0110(0),"I hope I can continue to serve here at the palace 
to the best of my ability.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0000(0),"You found Lara!? Please! You must tell me 
everything!",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0010(0),"Haha, so she did... Got married, and even went 
and had a kid, huh?",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0020(0),"Of course she did... A woman like that gets 
snatched up in no time.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0030(0),"She had no reason to hang around waiting for a 
fool who's thrown away everything.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0040(0),"...I was a weak man. Once I strayed off the path 
of what's right and good, I couldn't seem to find 
my way back to it.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0050(0),"I was once a guardsman in a certain town, but 
I...I had a problem with taking wagers I couldn't 
win. Ended up in debt and, eventually, right here.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0060(0),"I was out of control... I even lost myself Lara, 
when all she ever did was worry over me.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0070(0),"No, I didn't lose her... I ran away and left her.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0080(0),"And all I did from the day I left her was get 
deeper and deeper into trouble.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0090(0),Kevin. Time to go.,
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0100(0),...Yeah. I know.,
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0110(0),"Don't ever become like me. Regret always 
comes too late.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0120(0),But...you know...,
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0130(0),"I'm glad I at least got to find out about Lara. I'm 
glad I can meet my end knowing that she's 
happy.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A0_0140(0),Thank you.,
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0000(0),Ungh!,
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0010(0),"Hohoho! What is this, Yuri? Never before have I 
seen you bested in battle.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0020(0),"...I'm sorry you had to see such a disgraceful 
performance, milord.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0030(0),"Not at all! Your skill with the sword is a gift 
from the gods. I saw nothing shameful in your 
part of the battle.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0040(0),"...Is that how you would describe my defeat, 
milord? I would not choose such words myself.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0050(0),"My boy... What is this new obstinacy in you? I've 
never known you to be so bothered over a 
thing.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0060(0),"All the time we've been together, you have 
shown so little interest in any of the wonders 
we have seen. But this fire in you now...",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0070(0),"...I apologize if it offends you, milord.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0080(0),"...My defeat is, in effect, your defeat. I am your 
man, after all. Unless you should choose to 
release me now.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0090(0),"It is a wonder you can ever sit, such unbending 
pride you have!",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0100(0),"I chose you to be my bodyguard because I have 
faith in your skill. You have saved my life a 
dozen times, and I entrust my life to you still.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0110(0),"You...you are too generous with your praise, 
milord.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0120(0),"I am the one who was saved by you, when you 
chose a nameless swordsman like myself to be 
your personal guard.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0130(0),"I'm going to train harder than I ever have 
before to better protect milord in every 
situation.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0140(0),"Why...this is the first time I've heard such a 
declaration from you. I am honored, sir, by 
your loyalty.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A0_0150(0),"I'm glad I've had the chance to hear how my 
man truly feels about serving me. Thank you 
for providing him with such a worthy battle.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0000(0),"What's this? The logs of a great adventurer, you 
say? Let me see...",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0010(0),"My, my... Yes, it is very detailed...",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0020(0),"Look at this, would you? Those jutting peaks! 
And the natural wonders he describes and the 
native peoples... I can practically see them from 
these vibrant descriptions.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0030(0),.........,
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0040(0),"But I would rather see them in reality. I would 
like to lay my own eyes upon such wondrous 
sights.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0050(0),"I want to breathe deep of the air in this land he 
describes. I want to taste its foods and 
experience it with all five of my senses!",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0060(0),"There are still things in this world I have not 
seen! Ah, my heart is racing at the thought, as it 
has not done so these past few years!",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0070(0),"You must let me have this book. I do thank you 
for bringing it to me.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0080(0),"Hohoho... I suddenly feel twenty years younger! 
It's time to embark on a great journey into an 
unknown land!",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B0_0090(0),Hahaha! Haha!,
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0000(0),"Greetings. So are you the director of that 
mountain theater we hear so much about?",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0010(0),"Y-you are familiar with our modest theater, 
Your Majesty? That is an honor I would never 
have dreamed of.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0020(0),"Not at all. I feel much relieved to have you here 
to consult with.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0030(0),"You see, I have been considering a new 
entertainment for the benefit of my people, and 
the idea of a series of plays was proposed to 
me.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0040(0),"Th-that is wonderful to hear, Your Highness!",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0050(0),"But constructing a stage and assembling all we 
will need will cost a fair deal. That issue is one 
we must resolve to move forward.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0060(0),"I...I see. In that case, might I suggest something 
like this...?",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0070(0),"Hmm! I had little idea it was possible to do away 
with so much of the stage with only a bit of 
creative thinking.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0080(0),"Yes, Your Highness. The stage and props are 
naught but tools made to make the illusions 
easier to maintain. But a skilled player needs 
neither to captivate his or her audience.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0090(0),"So all we truly must provide is a space for the 
plays to be performed by able actors...",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0100(0),"If I'm not mistaken, Your Highness, it seems that 
you wish to host more than one play...?",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0110(0),"Perhaps you might provide your people not 
only with the joy of watching great theater, but 
also with the joy of creating great theater.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0120(0),"The joy...of creating great theater... Indeed! This 
is something I had overlooked!",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0130(0),"Yes, the pleasure of the theater is not restricted 
to those standing in the audience.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0140(0),"Merely watching another's acting and nothing 
else is to experience only half of the wonders 
the theater offers.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0150(0),"Giving the people the chance to not only witness 
great theater, but to take part in it—as actors, 
playwrights, directors...",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0160(0),"And in the process, supporting the development 
of skilled artisans who may continue to support 
the theater arts going forward...",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0170(0),"Nothing would please me more than being able 
to open the door to the world of the theater to 
more people.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0180(0),"And I should like nothing more than your 
assistance in this venture. Already your advice 
has been invaluable. Together we will make this 
an age of theater!",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0190(0),"I already have decided the topic of the first play, 
in fact.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0200(0),"Have you indeed, Your Highness?",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0210(0),"You must tell us of your journey, my good 
adventurers.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0220(0),"You have traveled the wide expanses of this 
continent. Your grand adventure should surely 
be the subject of our first performance!",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0230(0),"The eight tales of eight travelers, each walking 
the path that fate laid before their feet...",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A0_0240(0),"I do think that yours will be a tale capable of 
moving the hearts of men.",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A1_0000(0),"That hairdresser that you found for us has 
been a favorite of all the ladies in the court and 
is kept ever so busy.",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A1_0010(0),"She is a hard worker and skilled as well. We are 
truly blessed to have her.",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A1_0020(0),"The people at the palace have all been so good 
to me. I must do my best for their sake in 
return.",
TX_SS_DE3_0089A1_0030(0),"I will keep seeking to improve myself, so that I 
bring such beautiful smiles to the faces of all.",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A1_0000(0),"Even now, after all these years, I sometimes 
think... What would have been different if I had 
followed after Kevin, when he ran away?",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A1_0010(0),"It's silly, isn't it?",
TX_SS_DE3_0090A1_0020(0),"I wonder if I'll ever stop thinking about the man 
who threw me aside...",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A1_0000(0),"I've rededicated myself to the sword. I spend 
every day training to try to reach new heights 
with my blade.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091A1_0010(0),"It was a delight to find that I still had new things 
to learn of even at this age. Such as the 
dedication of my loyal man.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B1_0000(0),"My master says that he wants to set out upon 
a journey. I will go with him and keep him safe.",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B1_0010(0),"Hohoho...! The thought of getting to behold new 
sights again after so long is so titillating that I 
can hardly sit still!",
TX_SS_DE3_0091B1_0020(0),"Who knows? Perhaps I will put down my own 
discoveries in a book someday!",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A1_0000(0),"I'm pleased to say that the theater production is 
proceeding without issue.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A1_0010(0),"I still believe that your story will bring hope to 
the many. I look forward to the day when it 
may be witnessed by all my people.",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A1_0020(0),"I can hardly contain my excitement! To think, we 
will put on a play produced by the people and 
for the people...",
TX_SS_DE3_0092A1_0030(0),"I do believe we'll be able to give people the 
chance to discover the true joys of acting on 
the stage. This will be my greatest production 
ever.",
TX_SS_DE1_001800_0000(0),"Would you look at that? That useless sot is our 
hired arm. He's supposed to keep the peace 
when our customers get a bit rowdy.",
TX_SS_DE1_001800_0010(0),"But all he does is drink, not work. His coin 
disappears as quickly as the sands in an 
hourglass.",
TX_SS_DE1_001800_0020(0),"Maybe if someone actually bested him in a fight 
for once, he'd learn to take his position with a 
bit more gravity.",
TX_SS_DE1_001800_0030(0),"Me? Are you mad? Have you seen the size of 
him? I couldn't beat someone like that in a fight!",
TX_SS_DE1_001800_0040(0),"Hoo-ahhh! Damn, if they don't serve the best ale 
here!",
TX_SS_DE1_001800_0050(0),"Urp! And who're you? You lookin' for a dance? 
I'll take you on, sweetheart.",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0000(0),Sorry! We're rather busy at the moment!,
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0010(0),"That fugitive O'Neill has come running back here 
to his old hometown, trying to escape justice.",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0020(0),"O'Neill... He killed a noble and ran. He's a 
dangerous man.",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0030(0),"We've got to find him and stop him soon... You 
be careful on your travels!",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0040(0),Hah...hah...hah...,
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0050(0),"You a traveler? Then travel on, and leave me be.",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0060(0),"Well, you've got eyes, haven't you? Can't you 
see I'm a bit occupied?",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0070(0),"I lost my mistress. She was the greatest friend I 
had. Now every day I am alone...",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0080(0),"Now I hear her son is in some sort of trouble. 
She believed in him till her last breath. Never did 
believe he could be guilty.",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0090(0),"Even at the end, she insisted he must have had 
some reason for what he did and that he 
wouldn't ever do wrong.",
TX_SS_DE1_001900_0100(0),I remember that boy... His name was O'Neill.,
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0000(0),"Alas! No one turns their head at my dancing. I 
cannot catch anyone's eye.",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0010(0),"Dancing is nothing but a sorrow... Maybe it's 
time I hang up my dance shoes...",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0020(0),"But before I do, I want to stand on that stage 
and dance with grace one more time.",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0030(0),"I was a famous dancer once. Everyone in these 
sands knew my name.",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0040(0),"The last time that I performed on stage, I danced 
in this very dress: my infamous star dress.",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0050(0),"It was the greatest performance of my life. I 
was left with no regrets.",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0060(0),.........It's such a fine day outside.,
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0070(0),"I'll never be well enough to stay out for long, 
though. That's what I heard the doctor say...",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0080(0),"My girl isn't strong. It's too dangerous for her 
to leave the house for long.",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0090(0),"But all she speaks of is the ""blue dancing girl"" 
that she saw the last time she went to the 
town fete.",
TX_SS_DE1_002000_0100(0),"Perchance if I could find that ""blue dancing girl"" 
and have her dance for my daughter once 
more...",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0000(0),"Oh! So we meet again. The great merchant Ali, at 
your service.",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0010(0),"I've saved up a small fortune, if I do say so 
myself. I'm on my way back to my hometown 
now, in fact.",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0020(0),"I guess...my father's probably waiting for me to 
come back home.",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0030(0),.........,
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0040(0),"But for some reason...I find myself in no big 
hurry to get back...",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0050(0),Hrmmm...,
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0060(0),"O-oh! That's it! I just had an idea for a brilliant 
new pitch!",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0070(0),"You know how rodents are always causing 
trouble for the people who live in the desert? 
So everyone wants a cat that can be trained up 
as a great mouser?",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0080(0),"It can be a bit hard on folks, though, to keep a 
cat just for that purpose...",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0090(0),"That's where my Prowling Cat Clamor will come 
in! That's what I'll sell next!",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0100(0),"Even the fiercest rat will go running at the 
sound of a cat! And you won't have to pay for 
cat food, either!",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0110(0),"Hey, why don't you help me? Want to collect 
some Prowling Cat Clamor for yourself?",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0120(0),Off you go! You can do it!,
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0130(0),"...Not. Like that's even possible. There's no such 
thing.",
TX_SS_DE1_002100_0140(0),".........I'm sorry, Dad...",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0000(0),Urgh...,
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0010(0),"When did my arm get so slow? Have I really 
been that long out of practice?",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0020(0),"Well, I'm not having no more of that! It's off to 
the training yard for me!",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0030(0),"Phew... It was a good fight, though. First proper 
fight I've had in a long while.",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0040(0),"I didn't think you'd be able to handle yourself 
that well in a fight, friend!",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0050(0),"This one here's a right famous swordsman 
here in the desert. That's why I hired him to 
guard my shop.",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0060(0),"But everyone knows him by reputation. No one 
would ever dare start a fight with him that they 
couldn't finish. And in his boredom, he turned to 
the bottle.",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0070(0),"Hehe... But look at you now. You're looking like 
your old self again!",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A0_0080(0),"I think that whooping gave him just what he 
needed. Thank you, stranger.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0000(0),Grr... Damn it all!,
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0010(0),I can't let it all end here... Not like this!,
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0020(0),"We've got you now, fugitive!",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0030(0),"Now, don't bother fighting... Huh? Looks like 
you're in no shape to fight either way.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0040(0),"Traveler, did you...?",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0050(0),"Come on! This way with you, criminal!",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0060(0),.........,
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0070(0),"This one is a real villain. He killed a famous noble, 
the rotter.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0080(0),"He didn't even steal the man's riches or silver. 
But everyone knows it was him, all the same.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0090(0),"And instead of facing the justice he rightly 
deserves, he tried to run from the laws of the 
land.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0100(0),"But now justice will be served at last, thanks to 
you.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A0_0110(0),We thank you for your help with this matter.,
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0000(0),"Wh-what did you just say, traveler?",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0010(0),My mother...dead...?,
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0020(0),I...I see...,
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0030(0),.........,
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0040(0),"I'm facing the hangman's noose, but I've got no 
regrets for what I've done.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0050(0),"I killed that villain. I did. He deceived my friend 
and robbed him of everything he had.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0060(0),"Now my friend at least got his justice. And 
so...must I. I'm a murderer.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0070(0),But my mother always told me as a boy...,
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0080(0),"""You must always do what you believe to be 
right.""",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0090(0),"I've tried to live true to her words all my life, 
and I'll carry them with me to my grave.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0100(0),"I came back here because I wanted to see her 
one last time and say my farewells...",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0110(0),I suppose now I will meet her on the other side.,
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0120(0),"Thank you for telling me of her passing, traveler.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0130(0),"There he is! Stop right there, fugitive!",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B0_0140(0),You're coming with us!,
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0000(0),What is this? This dress... It's beautiful!,
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0010(0),It's...really just stunning.,
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0020(0),"It looks just like the dress worn by a great 
dancer I used to look up to ever so much.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0030(0),"How nostalgic to think of it now... When I first 
came here to this tavern, I practiced so 
desperately to try to dance as she did.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0040(0),"Things were so awful here, but the dancing... I 
always did love the dancing.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0050(0),"I've been dancing so many years now, but I 
wonder if I ever got close to her level at all...",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0060(0),"It's like a dream come true. To get to wear this 
dress just like hers, and dance on the stage as 
she did.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0070(0),Hehe... I suppose it is time for my last cue.,
TX_SS_DE1_0020A0_0080(0),...Thank you.,
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0000(0),It's you!,
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0010(0),"Mother! It's her! It's the blue dancing girl I saw in 
the town!",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0020(0),"She was the best of all the girls who were 
dancing!",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0030(0),"Oh! Well, goodness... That's very flattering to 
hear!",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0040(0),"But I'm not the best we have. We have a dancer 
who's better than all the rest...",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0050(0),"You may say that, but my daughter has never 
stopped insisting that you were the finest 
dancer she ever saw.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0060(0),"My daughter is not a healthy child, but she 
admired your dancing so...",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0070(0),"If you wouldn't mind, could I perhaps ask you to 
dance once more for her?",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0080(0),"I think it would give her a reason to keep trying 
to get better.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0090(0),"If you think my dances worthy... Then nothing 
would please me more.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0100(0),"You know, I was also sickly as a child.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0110(0),"But I never stopped believing in myself. Nor in a 
future when I would be well enough to dance.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0120(0),"I want you to promise me that you will do the 
same.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B0_0130(0),I promise!,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0000(0),Father...,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0010(0),"I was once known as the merchant with the 
golden tongue.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0020(0),"My own blasted son said he wanted to set out 
on his own journey to become a great 
merchant not too long ago.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0030(0),"I tried to stop him, said it was too early, and still 
he went.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0040(0),"He couldn't sell a starving man a steak. Probably 
off starving out there himself. He doesn't know 
a thing about making 'em want what you're 
selling.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0050(0),"That fool son of mine... I wonder where in the 
world he is now...",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0060(0),"That young merchant, Ali, he gave me a hunk of 
bread for nothing—not a leaf!—when I couldn't 
pay.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0070(0),"He said he'd left home after fighting with his 
father, and that he was still too ashamed to 
face the man again.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0080(0),"But I'd reckon he really wants to meet his old 
man. All he'd have to do is apologize properly, 
and I'm sure he'd be forgiven. That's what family 
does.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0090(0),,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0100(0),.........,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0110(0),"Kahahaha! So this is where you've been skulking 
about, eh?",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0120(0),"""I'm gonna become a better merchant than you 
ever were!"" That's what you boasted when you 
ran off, wasn't it?",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0130(0),"But your big mouth didn't serve you so well out 
in the real world, did it? Eh, Ali?",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0140(0),F-Father!?,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0150(0),Wh-wh-what are you doing here!?,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0160(0),"Hmph. Well, you never came home after that 
fight. What was I supposed to do?",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0170(0),"You're still such a child... Getting all bent out of 
shape and running away, just because you lost 
an argument to your old man.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0180(0),"You're saying <span style=""italic"">I</> lost the argument!? You haven't 
changed a bit since then! Still a stubborn old coot!",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0190(0),"You're the one who was wrong! I've been doing 
great as a merchant!",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0200(0),"Prepare yourself, old man. I wouldn't want you 
to keel over when you see this...",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0210(0),"What do you have to say about that, huh? See 
how much I've earned, making my way as a 
merchant?",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0220(0),"Ho! That's a fine bit you've earned, indeed.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0230(0),"And what about trust? Have you earned that as 
well, from the people you've been selling to?",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0240(0),What...?,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0250(0),"Trust is what a merchant needs to survive, not 
a pile of leaves. The money always comes 
second. Trust comes first.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0260(0),Father...,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0270(0),"Of course I've earned my customers' trust! I've 
never told a single lie to any of them.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0280(0),"...Is that so. Then I'm proud of you, my boy.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0290(0),You really...really never change...,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0300(0),"You know I only ever wanted to become a 
merchant because of you... You were like a 
hero to me when I was little...",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0310(0),.........,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0320(0),So I'm...I'm sorry.,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0330(0),"I've wanted to apologize all this time. I'm sorry I 
just ran away without a word like that. I'm 
sorry I made you worry...",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0340(0),.........,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0350(0),"The really important things are the hardest to 
say, aren't they? Even when they're just two 
little words.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0360(0),"...You did a fine job, son.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0370(0),"Welcome back, Ali. I'd say it's high time we both 
headed back home.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0380(0),Heh... Glad to be back.,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0390(0),"Hey, Dad...I've been thinking. What would you say 
to using this money I've saved to open up a 
new shop?",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A0_0400(0),"Kahahaha! Sounds like things are about to get 
pretty busy!",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A1_0000(0),"Now I can serve my customers without a 
worry. It's such a relief.",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A1_0010(0),"My fellow is doing his job just as expected. I've 
never been more glad I hired him!",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A1_0020(0),"Hey, where do you think—oh! It's you!",
TX_SS_DE1_0018A1_0030(0),"Almost didn't recognize you without my ale 
goggles on. Me, I won't touch a drop of the 
stuff any longer. I'll be dedicating myself to the 
job from now on.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A1_0000(0),"At least we managed to catch that fugitive 
before he killed again.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A1_0010(0),We truly do appreciate your help.,
TX_SS_DE1_0019A1_0020(0),"O'Neill was hanged till dead, just as he deserved.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A1_0030(0),"It was an odd thing, though... He looked at peace 
as they placed the noose around his neck.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019A1_0040(0),"And I heard him say, ""You must always do what 
you believe to be right.""",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B1_0000(0),"Everyone dies. In the end, you'll lose everyone.",
TX_SS_DE1_0019B1_0010(0),"The only thing you don't want to leave behind 
you when you go...is regret.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A1_0000(0),"Ah, you're here again? Well, thanks to you, I was 
able to pull off my greatest performance ever.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A1_0010(0),"I was able to dance my last dance in that dress... 
It is a memory I will treasure all my life.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A1_0020(0),...Now I have no regrets left.,
TX_SS_DE1_0020A1_0030(0),"You know, life is full of suffering. Life itself is 
the harshest stage we will ever stand upon.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A1_0040(0),"But even if you stumble upon that stage, you 
must climb to your feet again and continue 
dancing.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020A1_0050(0),Someday...someday you will get your reward.,
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0000(0),"What...did you think? Of my dancing, that is.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0010(0),"I was trying to bring that girl some courage, but 
I feel like I was the one who gained the most 
from our meeting.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0020(0),"Perhaps I was too hasty in thinking that it was 
time I give up on dancing...",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0030(0),"Getting to see that dancing girl perform right 
before me was like a dream come true!",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0040(0),"I will surely get better. And when I grow up 
healthy and strong, I will mount that stage for 
myself!",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0050(0),"My daughter has a new lease on life. She is 
determined now to beat her illness so that 
someday she can be a dancer as well.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0060(0),I owe that dancing girl so much...,
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0070(0),"You know, life is full of suffering. Life itself is 
the harshest stage we will ever stand upon.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0080(0),"But even if you stumble upon that stage, you 
must climb to your feet again and continue 
dancing.",
TX_SS_DE1_0020B1_0090(0),Someday...someday you will get your reward.,
TX_SS_DE1_0021A1_0000(0),"Boy... My father's definitely been out of the 
business a bit too long...",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A1_0010(0),"We've been talking about our new shop 
together, but we can't seem to agree on 
anything! All his ideas are so old-fashioned!",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A1_0020(0),"But, well, if we ever manage to open our shop, I 
hope you'll stop by.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A1_0030(0),"I've got years of experience. That cocky young 
son of mine ought to learn to respect that—and 
to respect my opinions when I'm right and he's 
wrong.",
TX_SS_DE1_0021A1_0040(0),"But, well... At this rate, I'm not sure we'll ever 
get that shop open!",
TX_SS_DE2_05200_0000(0),"I've charge of a traveling young lady, but I need 
to find a way to see her delivered safely to 
Sunshade...",
TX_SS_DE2_05200_0010(0),"I don't have the men to spare, though, to take 
her there. And with my own duties to attend to, 
I cannot possibly do it myself.",
TX_SS_DE2_05200_0020(0),"What I need to do, see, is find some other soul 
who will serve as the lady's protector in my 
place.",
TX_SS_DE2_05200_0030(0),"The guards here seem dedicated to their duty. 
That is good to see.",
TX_SS_DE2_05200_0040(0),"Not like in... Ah. Well. Never mind that. I only 
mean to say that it is a relief to find a place 
where the people can live in peace and security.",
TX_SS_DE2_05300_0000(0),"I've traveled all the way from Stillsnow, in the 
far north, in search of sweet delicacies to 
delight my tongue.",
TX_SS_DE2_05300_0010(0),"I'd thought that perhaps the dates which they 
sell in this region would be a good addition to 
my kitchen. I had heard they impart a delightful 
sweetness to any meal.",
TX_SS_DE2_05300_0020(0),"But the dates I've tasted here... Hrmmm. They 
have an undeniable aftertaste that quite ruins 
the effect.",
TX_SS_DE2_05300_0030(0),"Somewhere in this wide world there must be 
the perfect sweetener, capable of pleasing the 
tongue without such flaws.",
TX_SS_DE2_05300_0040(0),"You like beets? Of course you do! I mean, who 
doesn't, right?",
TX_SS_DE2_05300_0050(0),"And mine are like nothing you've ever tasted! 
You see, I let them rest nice and cozy beneath 
the snow till they're simply bursting with natural 
sugars. The flavor is simply to <span style=""italic"">die</> for!",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0000(0),"One of our scouts reported seeing a huge 
serpent lately, out in the Quicksand Caves.",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0010(0),"But no one believed the poor lad. He went off to 
those caves again on his own, claiming he'd 
prove us all wrong...",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0020(0),"Of course, if there really were such a terrible 
beast, we'd need to take care of it. We couldn't 
leave such a monster unchecked...",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0030(0),"Argh! I still can't believe it... How in the gods' 
name does he command that great serpent to 
do his bidding?",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0040(0),"Who am I talking about? Trust me, you're better 
off not knowing.",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0050(0),"I can't get another person involved. You don't 
understand how dangerous that man and his 
beast are.",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0060(0),"Hic! Whatchu lookin' at? I'll tell you what yer 
lookin' at. The future master of this whole 
town, tha's what! This's all gonna be mine 
someday... All of it...",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0070(0),"That drunk wastrel... He's always spouting off 
nonsense...",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0080(0),"The other day he was crying out about how he 
was gonna ""show us all"" with his ""giant 
scorpion."" What nonsense, right?",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0090(0),"Sure, he'd be plenty scary if he really could 
control a giant scorpion. But he's just a babbling 
old drunk!",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0000(0),Oh! So we meet again. And well met indeed.,
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0010(0),Captain! Please! This is no time for talking!,
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0020(0),"Gods' teeth, man... Would you insist that I don't 
even greet a former comrade? There is still 
such a thing as common decency!",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0030(0),"I'm very sorry, but the captain is a frightfully 
busy man.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0040(0),"The town's guard here depends entirely on 
Captain Bale.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0050(0),"I do not mean it to be so, but the greatest 
burden of the work always seems to fall upon 
him.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0060(0),"I know that it cannot continue on in this way... I 
know it, and yet it's so hard to change things.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0070(0),"But we are nearing the changing of the guards. 
If you can wait a little while, there should be 
more time to speak soon.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0080(0),"Oh! Gods, but you caught me quite unaware! I 
was lost in my own thoughts.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0090(0),"I have a very old friend, you see. A man named 
Donovan who serves the Church of the Flame 
as a bishop.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0100(0),"I've not heard any word from him of late, 
though...",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0110(0),"At first I was not concerned, but he has always 
been regular in his correspondence. Until now...",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0120(0),"Serving as the bishop of Goldshore keeps me 
busy day-in and day-out.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0130(0),"It's gotten to the point that I don't even have 
time for personal correspondence. Even penning 
a letter takes more time than I have at my 
disposal.",
TX_SS_DE2_05500_0140(0),"But I do wish I could at least let my friend know 
that I am well, if far too busy...",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0100(0),Those fools... How dare they fire me? Me!,
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0110(0),"Me and my precious pet will show them how 
wrong they were to humiliate me like that!",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0120(0),"Wh-who're you!? Were you eavesdropping on 
me, you wretch!?",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0130(0),"If you're planning to get in my way, then I'll 
simply take care of you first!",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0140(0),"Come to me, my pet!",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0150(0),"...There, there. We're good friends, now, aren't 
we?",
TX_SS_DE2_05400_0160(0),...Hm? Wh-what do you want? Leave me in peace!,
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0000(0),"Welcome back, Captain!",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0010(0),"Yes, it's good to be home. It was a worthwhile 
trip, though. I was able to observe quite a bit 
while traveling in disguise.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0020(0),"Heh heh... No need to look quite so surprised. 
You didn't realize that I was the captain of the 
guard here in this town?",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0030(0),"I'd heard talk about how things were being done 
in nearby settlements.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0040(0),"I've been thinking for some time of how I would 
like to observe how they organize their guard 
and their patrols.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0050(0),"But for an impartial view of the situation, I knew 
I couldn't go as myself.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0060(0),"You could have just sent any of us, Captain. We 
would have been happy to report back for you...",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0070(0),"No, I couldn't have. I don't mean to insult your 
capabilities, of course, but...",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0080(0),"Well, I trust my own eyes above any other's. I 
would not have been satisfied unless I saw the 
situation for myself.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0090(0),"Yes, ma'am. I can appreciate that.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0100(0),"...Now then. I thank you for seeing me safely 
back here.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0110(0),"I'd asked for an escort in that oasis hoping to 
see how well the soldiers there might perform.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0120(0),"But instead I ended up with you. A happy 
miscalculation, I suppose.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0130(0),"You performed beautifully. I will be sure to use 
you as an example for my own troops.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0140(0),"Now then. This trip has given me plenty of ideas 
for how we can do better, and I shall be putting 
them into practice at once.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A0_0150(0),"Yes, ma'am!",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0000(0),"Oh, something new to try? I'll be happy to do 
that. Thank you!",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0010(0),"Mm-hmm! This does indeed have promise! It is a 
clean, pure sweetness, indeed!",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0020(0),"But why? It looks like nothing more than a 
perfectly common beet. What's that? You say 
this beet is from my homeland of Stillsnow!?",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0030(0),"Ah! That's it! It must be the cold! The cold must 
cause the beets to develop more sugars as 
they grow!",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0040(0),"With this kind of sugar content, I think that I 
could simply squeeze the roots to extract a 
sweet juice.",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0050(0),"Hahahaha! Sometimes you can travel the whole 
world only to find that the thing you sought 
was lying right outside your front door the 
entire time!",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0060(0),"What kind of gourmand am I? Overlooking the 
perfect sweet right before me! Clearly there is 
still much for me to learn!",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0070(0),"I am tempted to start my journey anew, but this 
time with my eyes properly opened to the 
natural bounty surrounding me!",
TX_SS_DE2_053A0_0080(0),"Thank you for giving me a taste of a whole new 
world!",
TX_SS_DE2_054A0_0000(0),"You're the one who came asking about the 
serpent! Don't tell me... You defeated it!?",
TX_SS_DE2_054A0_0010(0),"I never actually believed that there was a giant 
serpent like that...",
TX_SS_DE2_054A0_0020(0),I told you! Why didn't you believe me then!?,
TX_SS_DE2_054A0_0030(0),I should have... Forgive me?,
TX_SS_DE2_054A0_0040(0),"But you actually managed to bring that giant 
serpent down... I sure wasn't able to do it. 
You're strong, all right.",
TX_SS_DE2_054A0_0050(0),"I owe you my thanks as well. I'm glad it was 
taken care of before anyone else got hurt.",
TX_SS_DE2_054A0_0060(0),"We'll be more cautious from now on. It's too 
late to stop such a beast <span style=""italic"">after</> it has already 
claimed victims.",
TX_SS_DE2_054A0_0070(0),Thank you for reminding us of that.,
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0000(0),"This man is the one who was behind that giant 
serpent in the caves.",
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0010(0),"What were you thinking, setting a creature like 
that loose!?",
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0020(0),"Who are you to criticize me!? I will have my 
revenge!",
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0030(0),"Those filthy misers in the black market... I 
worked as a bodyguard to them for years, and 
they suddenly decide they've got no need for 
me anymore, is that it!?",
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0040(0),"But now they'll learn better than to think they 
can get along without me! Now that I've got my 
serpent!",
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0050(0),"...And that's why you brought that giant serpent 
here? For revenge upon your former 
employers?",
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0060(0),"That's right! I trained and trained to be able to 
bend that beast to my will!",
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0070(0),"...He's even more despicable than I thought. It's a 
good thing we caught him now.",
TX_SS_DE2_054B0_0080(0),You really saved us from a spot of trouble here.,
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0000(0),"I had hoped I would be seeing you again. Do you 
have good news to report to me—or ill?",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0010(0),"...I see. So Donovan is still in good health. And his 
daughter is seven already!",

him so busy. But then Donovan was always a 
single-minded man.",

met him.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0040(0),"I was a mercenary in those days, wandering 
various lands in search of work.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0050(0),"I met Donovan only a short time after he met 
his wife.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0060(0),"They were dark days... His wife was kidnapped 
in the early days of their marriage, you see.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0070(0),"And I was captured by the Knights Ardante, who 
had mistaken me for the villain responsible.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0080(0),"I was nothing but a wandering vagrant. I had no 
one to vouch for me, no way to prove my 
innocence. I thought I would be hanged till dead.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0090(0),"But I was fortunate that Lord Woodward, the 
head of the Knights Ardante, and Donovan both 
believed me innocent.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0100(0),"It was only thanks to their firm belief that the 
true criminal was found at last.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0110(0),"Hah... It's been a long time since I last thought of 
those days.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0120(0),"I certainly never would have imagined then that I 
might one day be standing here in such a 
position of authority.",

that the work I am doing now is worth doing.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0140(0),"But still...that does not mean that I never look 
back to the past and long for those days.",
TX_SS_DE2_055A0_0150(0),"But I believe that everything happens for a 
reason. I stand here today because of where I 
was in all my yesterdays. They have served 
their purpose.",

of me to not put it into practice.",

to live on all the continent.",
TX_SS_DE2_052A1_0020(0),"A town where everyone can live in peace and 
smile always. It would be lovely if it could be 
achieved, don't you think?",
TX_SS_DE2_053A1_0000(0),"I'm looking into ways to extract the sugary 
juices from beetroot.",
TX_SS_DE2_053A1_0010(0),"But to be of any use, the sugars need to be in a 
form that can easily be kept and used in 
cooking... Something like grains of sand...",
TX_SS_DE2_053A1_0020(0),"Yes. Granulated sugar... I can't believe no one has 
thought of such a thing before! I may just be a 
genius!",

that could have come to live in those ruins...",

getting involved.",
TX_SS_DE2_054A1_0020(0),"What's happened to my beloved scorpion...? 
It's...it's disappeared!",

TX_SS_DE2_054B1_0000(0),"We tried searching the Quicksand Caves and the 
nearby area for that giant serpent...",
TX_SS_DE2_054B1_0010(0),"But we didn't see any sign of it anywhere. I 
suppose it must have already left for a bigger 
hunting ground.",
TX_SS_DE2_054B1_0020(0),"And that man who was controlling the 
creature... Unbelievable. I didn't know there were 
such petty people in the world.",
TX_SS_DE2_054B1_0030(0),Thank you for helping to put a stop to him.,
TX_SS_DE2_054B1_0040(0),"Who fires a person just because they've run up 
a bit of a tab at the tavern anyway? You 
understand my ire, don't you? I see it in your 
eyes, all right.",

TX_SS_DE2_052A1_0030(0),"Thank you for looking after that lady traveler 
for us. I truly appreciated it.",

we met. I have been thinking...that perhaps I 
might set out on a short journey.",

raise a glass together. Then I will return to this 
town and continue to do the work that needs 
to be done here.",

where you know you are needed and wanted.",

Perhaps you've heard of me?",

adventurer prepare for the journey of a 
lifetime?",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0060(0),"I've assembled quite a spectacular set of goods, 
if I do say so myself.",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0070(0),"I'm most certain it would be useful to anyone 
preparing for an adventure!",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0220(0),"Hoho, it almost looks like you're getting ready 
to set out on an adventure!",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0080(0),"Why, this is... This is precisely the sort of 
equipment a great adventurer like myself needs!",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0090(0),"It cannot be that you prepared all of this for my 
sake, can it!?",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0100(0),"Forgive me... To have a complete stranger go to 
such lengths for me...",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0110(0),.........,
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0120(0),"And yet...since you have already gone to such 
lengths, would it not be more rude for me to 
refuse your generosity now?",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0130(0),"...You don't mind, do you?",
TX_SS_SE4_010900_0140(0),"Thank you! You are no stranger—no, from 
today we are fast friends!",

some more stock soon...",
TX_SS_SE4_011000_0000(0),It's you! My fast friend and companion!,
TX_SS_SE4_011000_0010(0),"It is I, the great adventurer Le Mann! Surely you 
have not forgotten me?",
TX_SS_SE4_011000_0020(0),"I was well on my way to uncovering a new 
continent, when I came up against a most 
perilous plight.",

Mann.",

between the two of us, he can't even tie his 
shoelaces without someone's help.",

it always falls to me to give him the push he 
needs to get moving again.",

But I really thought that you would do it if you 
were given the chance...",

I'll never speak to you again.",

look back!",

you've had a true adventure.",

away...",
TX_SS_SE4_011000_0320(0),"I do hope Le Mann is having himself a fine 
adventure.",

and discouraged yet again.",

you could defeat the brigands for me?",

pass by this way, you'll have to pay the passage 
fee.",

gonna have to pay it. Or pay with your blood. 
Bahahaha!",

the last you'll see of me!",

completely unknown lands.",

long since over.",

took after his father.",

him...",

there must have been some circumstances that

friend.",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0000(0),"So we have indeed met again! Do you 
remember me? Sir Miles of the Knights Ardante?",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0010(0),"I have been continuing in my hopes of 
discovering the truth about my father.",

the taste of real battle is quite different from

people is an important duty of the Knights 
Ardante.",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0260(0),"I'd hardly been given my first appointment

TX_SS_SN4_010400_0030(0),"I realized how far I still have to go as a 
swordsman. How about a bit of a match 
between you and I?",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0040(0),"Phew... You are every bit as strong as I had 
imagined.",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0050(0),Very far indeed have I yet to come as a knight...,
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0060(0),"But that matters naught! I feel I have understood 
something new this day, in battling with you. I 
will set off again with renewed vigor!",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0070(0),"You there, boy...",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0080(0),"Was your father perhaps a member of the 
Knights Ardante?",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0090(0),"You look quite uncannily alike to a certain 
member of the Knights Ardante who once 
saved my life.",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0100(0),You...you knew my father!?,
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0110(0),"Certainly did. A hero, he was. He saved us all.",

mind.",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0140(0),"But I still remember those days of terror. Our 
village was being preyed upon by a whole pack 
of aggressive beasts.",

for us was that father of yours.",

fight, he did not abandon us in our hour of need.",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0170(0),"He marched right out of this village, not a man 
at his back, and fought off the beasts for us.",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0180(0),"It is thanks to your father that I'm here today 
to relate the tale to you.",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0190(0),"My conviction grows ever stronger! I knew my 
father was no deserter!",

same...",
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0210(0),The truth must still be out there somewhere.,
TX_SS_SN4_010400_0220(0),I must go on until I find it!,

father's legacy, as well.",

might be sent on my next mission...",

my hands on in some time. This is surely a blade 
with some stories behind it!",

that sword will be my next challenge. That is the 
most exciting part of doing what it is I do!",

doubting its strength.",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0070(0),You there... Where did you get that sword?,
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0080(0),This sword belonged to my father once.,
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0090(0),...And you are?,
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0100(0),"I was saved by the man who wielded that 
sword. So you...are the son of that great hero!",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0110(0),You...you knew my father?,
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0120(0),"Oh, aye. He saved my entire village, long ago, 
when we were set upon by wild beasts.",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0130(0),"We had no one to help us. None but a traveling 
knight of the Knights Ardante, who happened to 
come through our village.",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0140(0),"The village leaders begged that he might see us 
to safety.",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0150(0),"And that fine knight agreed at once. Not a soul 
perished.",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0160(0),"But he did not consider his duty done then. He 
even entrusted his sword to the village.",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0170(0),"He instructed us to sell the fine steel and use 
the money to buy food and seeds.",

must never abandon his duty under any 
circumstances.",

of the cause.",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0200(0),"That is what I've heard, and still that great man... 
He accepted such dishonor without hesitation, 
to aid perfect strangers such as ourselves.",
TX_SS_SN4_010500_0210(0),"I set out to learn the sword myself because of 
your father... He is what made me into the man 
I am today.",

Knights Ardante, but I am able to keep clothes 
on my back at least, living as a hired sword.",

this should work...",

woven sack, and it is done!",
TX_SS_SN2_034A0_0040(0),Ohhh! It's so toasty! I feel warmed to my core!,

is absolutely paramount.",
TX_SS_SN2_034A0_0060(0),"Look at the roofs of the buildings, for example. 
You see how the snow piles up? Well, one must 
knock the snow off quite regularly or the 
weight becomes too much for them.",
TX_SS_SN2_034A0_0070(0),"But how do you keep yourself warm when 
you're out knocking snow from the roof? You 
can't have a stove in your pocket, and good luck 
starting a fire in the snow.",
TX_SS_SN2_034A0_0080(0),"But if you have one of these, you can warm 
yourself even when you're out clearing snow!",

keep children warm when they are out playing 
in the winter snows.",

warmth that you happen to fall asleep, there's 
no worry about things burning out of control.",

safe and comfortable!",

me!?",

just...I only ever...",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0020(0),"...Lost hold of that temper of yours again, did 
you? Looks like all it earned you was a good 
beating.",

TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0040(0),"Hmph. But maybe this time something'll actually 
get through to you.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0050(0),"...You've seen your fair share of troubles, 
friend. I know that. You didn't used to be like this.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0060(0),"This fellow used to have a small shop of his 
own, see. But his business went under, and he 
lost everything.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0070(0),"He always was the serious type. I guess the 
failure was just too much for him to handle. 
Broke his heart.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0080(0),"He turned to drink, looking to drown his 
sorrows. And look at 'im now.",

huh!? I never did nothing to deserve this kind of 
ill fortune!",

weight on my family the way I am now...",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0120(0),"But you can't expect me to start over anew at 
this age...",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0130(0),"I can, and I do. It's not too late if you start now.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0140(0),I...I don't...,
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0150(0),"...Looks like he got a bit of that bile out of him 
after losing his temper like that.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A0_0160(0),"Thank you for giving him the chance to work 
through some of that anger.",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0000(0),"You the one? The one who wants to be a 
singer? Then let's have a song out of you.",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0010(0),O-oh... Of course...,
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0020(0),"Yes! That's it! This is the voice I've been 
searching for!",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0030(0),"I've been looking for a singer to take center 
stage in my tavern.",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0040(0),"And your voice... Oh, it's sweeter than any wine 
I've got on offer! You must come and sing for 
me!",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0050(0),"You truly wish me to sing for you!? I...well, I 
would absolutely love to, but I...I can't.",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0060(0),"And why not? You want to be a singer, don't 
you?",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0070(0),"I do...but my family... They cannot make it 
without me. I'm afraid we owe a great deal to a 
moneylender, and...",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0080(0),"And nothing! I will take your debts on as my 
own!",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0090(0),What!? B-but you can't possibly—!,
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0100(0),"It's nothing compared to the profit you'll bring 
my tavern soon enough!",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0110(0),"Your voice has enchanted me, my girl. You are 
the only one I'll have on my stage!",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0120(0),"Then...yes, I do want to sing! I would be delighted 
to sing for you!",
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0130(0),Nothing would please me more.,
TX_SS_SN2_035B0_0140(0),"Thank you for introducing me to the singer of 
my dreams!",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0000(0),Ah...,
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0010(0),"There must be such loyal creatures somewhere 
in this world. Good and true servants who only 
wish to work under the roof of a good 
mistress.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0020(0),"But there are, ma'am. You have one right here.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0030(0),...Pardon?,
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0040(0),"You may call me Arianna, if it pleases you, my 
lady. And I would gladly serve you till my last 
day, if you would but let me.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0050(0),"Oh! What a lovely way ye have with words! That 
calm grace, that poise, and those manners... Yes, 
I think we could get on very well.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0060(0),Would ye truly like to work as my lady's maid?,
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0070(0),"I swear that nothing could please me more in 
this world, my lady.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0080(0),"Haha... Then I am glad to welcome ye into my 
employ, Miss Arianna.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0090(0),Now there's only one more thing I need...,
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0100(0),"I'm still lackin' a good coachman to see me 
about in my carriage.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0110(0),"Do ye happen to know any coachman seekin' 
new employment?",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0120(0),"If it pleases my lady, I might know of such a 
man. He is a skilled coachman, to be sure. I rode 
many a treacherous road in his coach and 
never came to misfortune.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0130(0),"Oh! That does sound promisin'! It's as though the 
stars've aligned for me!",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0140(0),"Only...I am afraid that his manners can be a bit 
curt. I cannot say for sure what you might think 
of him, if he should even be willing to come 
here to work.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0150(0),I wonder what he must be doing these days...,
TX_SS_SN2_036A0_0160(0),"I'd be delighted to have a good coachman as 
well...",
TX_SS_SN2_034A1_0000(0),"I've decided on a name for my latest invention. 
You tuck one in your jacket, and if you slip your 
hands in near to it, they will feel warm in no 
time. So I will call them handy-warmers!",
TX_SS_SN2_034A1_0010(0),"Simple but telling, don't you think? Now I'm going 
to perfect their design to make my handy-
warmers even more convenient!",
TX_SS_SN2_034A1_0020(0),"I'd be happy if my handy-warmers gave 
everyone in this chilly land a little hand up.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A1_0000(0),"My father suddenly came home and said that he 
was going to start working again! It's just like 
the old days!",
TX_SS_SN2_035A1_0010(0),"If he truly goes back to work, then maybe I can 
pursue my own dreams as well... I can finally try 
to become a singer!",
TX_SS_SN2_035A1_0020(0),"...It's not too late. I'm going to work hard and 
repay all our debts.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A1_0030(0),"I want to at least give my girl the chance to 
pursue her own dreams.",
TX_SS_SN2_035A1_0040(0),"I think it's really thanks to you that he was able 
to drag himself back up onto his feet again.",
TX_SS_SN2_035B1_0000(0),Oh! You're the one from that time!,
TX_SS_SN2_035B1_0010(0),"I get to sing in front of so many people now at 
the tavern. It's really a dream come true!",
TX_SS_SN2_035B1_0020(0),"There are more than a few customers who 
come to the tavern these days just to hear that 
girl sing.",
TX_SS_SN2_035B1_0030(0),"If I didn't run the place, I dare say I'd be one of 
them myself!",
TX_SS_SN2_036A1_0000(0),"Oh! Are ye the coachman that my Arianna spoke 
of?",
TX_SS_SN2_036A1_0010(0),.........,
TX_SS_SN2_036A1_0020(0),"How glad I am that fate has brought us 
together. Would ye care to come work in my

my servants.",

was.",

warm here. In so many ways.",

work and barely keeping afloat...",
TX_SS_SN2_036A1_0140(0),"Now at last I feel like I've found a place where I 
can settle down and truly live.",
TX_SS_SN2_036A1_0150(0),"Now then! It's time we get down to work, I'd 
say! Today is the first day of your new postin', 
my two!",
TX_SS_SN2_036A1_0160(0),"I should quite like to go into town for a bit of 
shoppin'. Arianna, would ye accompany me?",

TX_SS_SN2_036A1_0180(0),It's...warm here.,

always pestering me and putting himself in my 
way.",

do his enflame him further. He has become so 
persistent that I fear he may turn violent...",

positively a bother to everyone! Someone must 
do something about him...",

Gahahaha!",
TX_SS_SN1_000100_0070(0),"...And what's your problem, huh? You don't like 
a bit of fun or something? A fight'd at least be a

take you on!",
TX_SS_SN1_000200_0000(0),"...It's no good! I simply cannot see the way of it! 
That's it. It is all over now. My research is done

some proof that my years of research weren't 
for naught...",

something about giants and such nonsense.",
TX_SS_SN1_000200_0050(0),"Doesn't make a whit of sense. But apparently he 
was once quite the famous scholar. It's always 
sad to see a great mind gone to waste like that, 
don't you think?",
TX_SS_SN1_000200_0060(0),"Ah, where does the time go? I set out to find 
the truth of the ice giants known as the jötunn, 
and before I knew what had happened, my 
whole life had passed me by...",
TX_SS_SN1_000200_0070(0),"But it is a most fascinating tale once you begin 
delving into the details. The nomenclature, for 
example. You see, the reason that the jötunn 
are commonly known as ""ice giants"" is in part 
because...",
TX_SS_SN1_000200_0080(0),"Ah. Dear me. There I go again with my 
ramblings. I do apologize. Please pay this old

I've not killed anyone! I've never done it!",

was a person there, covered in blood... What 
would anyone do? Of course I bent down to see 
if they were all right. I was only trying to help!",

should be 【★Firewood】 enough to see me through 
the coming winter.",

We were happy.",
TX_SS_SN1_000400_0090(0),"He did leave me with a fine house to live on in,

a house just isn't a home when you are all

TX_SS_SN1_000500_0050(0),"There's a real beauty here in the town of 
Flamesgrace. The most beautiful woman in all

TX_SS_SN1_000500_0070(0),"I've had lords from many lands come to pay me 
their attentions.",

Why should I tie myself down now? Who knows

lives...",
TX_SS_SN1_000600_0040(0),"But...but I still haven't done anything to atone for 
my crimes.",
TX_SS_SN1_000600_0050(0),I think I have to go back to Wispermill.,

This wasn't what we planned!",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A0_0030(0),"You fool! What timing! Why couldn't you have 
shown up five minutes earlier!?",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A0_0040(0),"...All right. The farce is up. Let's just put this 
whole sorry affair to rest.",

me there's this girl he's fallen for...",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A0_0060(0),"I was to act the villain while he would swoop in 
and save the day. Then he'd show off his good 
side and get the girl.",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A0_0070(0),I-I really thought it was gonna work. Oh well...,
TX_SS_SN1_0001A0_0080(0),"Please tell that girl I meant no harm. I'm sorry 
for giving her so much grief.",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0000(0),"Well, I'll be...! Is that the horn of a jötunn!?",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0010(0),"With this kind of proof, then surely my theories 
will start to have some weight... I'll be able to 
find a patron and continue my research!",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0020(0),"Little is known about the jötunn. They are 
elusive creatures, so much so that many doubt 
that they even truly exist.",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0030(0),"But this horn... Oh, it is in beautiful condition! A 
specimen like this will change some minds at last!",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0040(0),"When I was only a boy, a scholar passed 
through the town where I was living. He was on 
a journey, but he told me tales of ice-covered 
giants living in a frozen land.",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0050(0),"His tales are what started me on this path, as a 
scholar.",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0060(0),"But I was only a boy then. If I ever knew the 
man's name, I certainly don't recall it any longer.",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0070(0),"Still...if my memories are no lie, and he was truly 
the man I thought him to be, then I imagine he 
must be out there somewhere, looking for 
giants, even now...",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A0_0080(0),"Now it is time that I get back to my own work! 
Thank you so much for this great boon!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0000(0),"A witness, huh? Wouldn't that be convenient. If 
only it were true.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0010(0),"Give up on the lies already. If you'd just admit 
what you did, maybe the judge'd go easier on 
you.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0020(0),"But I didn't do it! I swear, I'm innocent!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0030(0),"It was an accident that killed that man, not me! 
There must be someone who saw what 
happened!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0040(0),"How come no one has come forward then? No 
one's gonna believe a pack of lies like that!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0050(0),"That traveler there found a witness for me! 
Just ask, and they'll tell you!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0060(0),Hey. You there. Is he telling the truth then?,
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0070(0),"...Hrmmm. An accident, huh? I s'ppose I'll have to 
look into this.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0080(0),All right. I've heard from this witness of yours.,
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0090(0),"And I've asked around with a few other people, 
as well.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0100(0),And...well...looks like you were telling the truth.,
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0110(0),That's right I was!,
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0120(0),"I only chanced to pass by that night! It was 
nothing but happenstance!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0130(0),"And then what do I see but a person lying on 
the ground, covered in blood...",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0140(0),"I was trying to see if they were all right, when 
you lot took me for a murderer!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0150(0),"...Yes, we may have been a bit hasty.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0160(0),My commander told me to let you go.,
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0170(0),...R-really!?,
TX_SS_SN1_0003A0_0180(0),"This is all thanks to you! You've saved my life, 
stranger!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0000(0),"Isn't that the key to this cell!? Are you...are you 
going to set me free!?",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0010(0),"I can't thank you enough for this. I thought I 
might never see freedom again!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0020(0),"I'm really not a murderer, I swear it! I swear it 
by the Sacred Flame itself!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0030(0),"I found that man covered in blood, and I was 
just trying to help him up but... He wasn't 
breathing...",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0040(0),"I guess someone saw me with the body and 
misunderstood what I was doing there.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0050(0),"They screamed ""Murderer!"" And I...I ran away. I 
didn't think about what it would look like. I 
simply ran.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0060(0),"My younger brother is about to get married, 
too. I came back to this town just for the 
wedding.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0070(0),"I ran away and left home when he was still just 
a kid. I left everything on him. I hate to even 
imagine everything he had to do on his own, all 
because I wasn't there...",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0080(0),"That's why I had to get free from this cell. I 
have to make it to his wedding at least, and tell 
him how sorry I am for what happened when 
we were young...",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0090(0),"I'll never forget what you did for me this day. I 
swear it. Thank you, kind stranger.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0100(0),"Now I've got to be going! And I can be going, all 
because of <span style=""italic"">you</>!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B0_0110(0),Gods be with you!,
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0000(0),"Wha... You're giving me all this? Y-you're sure 
about this?",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0010(0),"There's clothes and food and wood for 
burning... This'll be enough to see me through 
the winter alive!",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0020(0),"It's been real tough since the weather started 
turning, but...you've gone and shown me that 
there's decent folk in the world still!",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0030(0),"But really, you sure about this? You must've 
gone to a lot of work to get all this stuff...",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0040(0),"I...I've never even thought of sharing my hard-
earned spoils with another.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0050(0),"There are still lots of other kids like me in this 
town. Hungry kids with nowhere left to go.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0060(0),"Since you shared this all with me...I reckon I'd 
better go share it with them, too!",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0070(0),"If I do, maybe we'll all make it through another 
winter.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0080(0),"Thank you, stranger. I'll always remember you 
as my savior.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0000(0),"Are you all alone, child? Wherever are your 
parents?",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0010(0),"...Don't have any. Never did, far as I know.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0020(0),I've been alone as long as I can remember.,
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0030(0),"Is that right...? I am alone now, too.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0040(0),You are?,
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0050(0),"I am. All alone in a house that's far too much 
for a lonely soul like me. I rattle around in there 
and feel like the only person left in the world.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0060(0),Oh... I've never had a house to rattle around in...,
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0070(0),.........,
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0080(0),"You know, child...",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0090(0),Huh? What?,
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0100(0),"If you wished to...you could perhaps live there, 
too.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0110(0),...I could?,
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0120(0),"I would not have to be so lonely there either, if 
you were my child.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0130(0),"Y-you sure, ma'am? Like, really sure?",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0140(0),"Of course. My house is quite snug and warm, 
even in winter. You won't have to worry about 
a thing there.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0150(0),"Really? I mean...if you're sure about letting 
someone like me stay there...",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B0_0160(0),"I am. So I suppose it's all settled then. You will 
come to live with me.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005A0_0000(0),"D-damn! You're a strong one, all right.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005A0_0010(0),"I've traveled wide in this world, but never have I 
been so soundly defeated!",
TX_SS_SN1_0005A0_0020(0),"And indeed, I have been driven to my knees 
before you.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005A0_0030(0),"Then you get what was promised to you. This 
【★Reward】 is yours. The only one of its kind in all 
the world.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005A0_0040(0),"But don't think this trouncing will stop me. Such 
discoveries are exactly what makes the journey 
worth taking!",
TX_SS_SN1_0005A0_0050(0),"Fare well, friend!",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0000(0),"Oh... Oh, what beauty! Who is this vision before 
me?",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0010(0),"I have traveled long around this world and 
never have I seen beauty such as yours, my 
lady!",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0020(0),"I've heard the same from many lords and 
nobles. So many times that I weary of such 
pretty words.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0030(0),"Do not offer me pretty words then, sir. Offer 
me truth instead.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0040(0),"Truth! Quite so, my lady. Quite so.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0050(0),"Then in truth, my beauty, I would have you as 
my wife. Be my companion in all my days!",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0060(0),...You would fall to your knees before me?,
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0070(0),"I've seen many men on their knees. I have no 
interest in seeing another.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0080(0),"...Ho. So I was brought low to my knees at last, 
if only by love. Then as promised, I must hand 
over this 【★Reward】.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005B0_0090(0),Dahahahaha! What a fool I have been!,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0000(0),"So, they came again...",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0010(0),They did. It is most vexsome.,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0020(0),"Oh! I should introduce you. This is Eliza 
Woodward.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0030(0),Her father once headed the Knights Ardante.,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0040(0),"Pray don't mention it, Lianna! His achievements 
are not my own.",

the ruins where that altar lay...",

were also acquainted with Miss Lianna.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0070(0),"Well, if we all know one another, that makes 
things even easier. Never mind the niceties. The 
point is this...",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0080(0),"I want to find out more about that altar where 
Mattias held his awful ceremony.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0090(0),"Yes. We had even gathered together a goodly 
number of people to aid us in this venture...",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0100(0),"But someone doesn't want us to. Our provisions 
have been ransacked, and we meet with 
obstacles every step we take.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0110(0),"We've made no progress at all, as a result. It is 
truly a bother.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0120(0),There is someone behind this. That's for sure.,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0130(0),"And the villagers who had been willing to help 
us are now growing wary.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0140(0),"Do you think you could help us unravel this 
mystery?",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0150(0),"I don't think it's just indiscriminate villainry. I think 
someone does <span style=""italic"">not</> want us to find those ruins 
again.",

someday...",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0180(0),"We may have lost our savior, but the accurst 
flame will not be extinguished!",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0090(0),What's that!? You actually found me a witness!?,
TX_SS_SN1_0004A0_0100(0),"Hey! You there! You can't just wander in here 
and talk to prisoners!",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A0_0190(0),"Word has it the thieves' den is deep in the 
Forest of Purgation. I wonder if we might find 
something there.",

things...",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A1_0010(0),"Though, if that captain was willing to go so far 
for his lieutenant then, well...",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A1_0020(0),"Looking at him now, he does cut quite the 
figure. Rather dashing, in fact.",

care how desperately any of my men ask me...",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A1_0040(0),"But is it only my imagination? Ever since then, I 
feel as if that lady's eyes have been burning into 
me...",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A1_0050(0),"You know, I feel like my lady is always watching 
the captain of late.",
TX_SS_SN1_0001A1_0060(0),"I...I don't think this has worked out at all as I'd 
hoped it would...",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A1_0000(0),"I've got the physical proof I desired, so now I

TX_SS_SN1_0002A1_0010(0),"Once I am done, I will share my findings with the 
academy!",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A1_0020(0),"I remember sharing my own findings about the 
jötunn with the people I met on my own 
journeys, long ago. One boy in particular stands 
out in my memories...",
TX_SS_SN1_0002A1_0030(0),"Oh, how that boy's eyes did sparkle when I told 
him my tales!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A1_0000(0),"I never dreamed how terrible it would be... To 
be imprisoned for something you didn't even do.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A1_0010(0),"I'm thinking of starting a new line of work, in 
fact.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A1_0020(0),"I will work to search out witnesses of crimes, 
and help find proof for those who are truly 
innocent.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A1_0030(0),"I will be an advocate for those who are accused 
of crimes they did not commit. I feel like I've 
finally found what it is I am meant to do in life!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B1_0000(0),"You truly saved me, you know. If you hadn't 
brought that key, well...I don't even like to 
imagine what might've happened.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B1_0010(0),"And I was able to attend my brother's wedding 
as well.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B1_0020(0),"My brother has even offered to help me work 
to prove my innocence. It's more than I ever 
could've dreamed he might do, after all these 
years.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B1_0030(0),"We're going to do our best to fix all this 
together. Thank you again!",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A1_0000(0),"Boy, I can't thank you enough for all you did! I 
think this is going to be the best winter I've ever 
had.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A1_0010(0),"I went and shared everything you gave me with 
the others, and I think we're gonna have enough 
clothing and food to make it through.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004A1_0020(0),"And I discovered something else, too. When 
we're all together, the cold doesn't even feel 
half as bad!",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B1_0000(0),"The house is so much livelier now with that boy 
around to keep me company.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B1_0010(0),"Having family... Having someone else to share 
your home and life with is a joy.",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B1_0020(0),"Gran's house is so warm and nice! This is going 
to be the best winter ever!",
TX_SS_SN1_0004B1_0030(0),"And, I dunno, being together with Gran... It made 
me feel warm <span style=""italic"">inside</>, too, all the way to my 
toes.",
TX_SS_SN1_0005A1_0000(0),Now where shall I head next? Dahahahaha!,
TX_SS_SN1_0005B1_0000(0),"I'd truly never seen a beauty like that before. 
Seems like there's plenty left for me to discover 
in my world travels!",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A1_0040(0),"That drunkard of a soldier just came by to ask 
me about what happened last night.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003A1_0050(0),"When I explained what I'd seen, he went green 
all over and rushed off somewhere.",
TX_SS_SN1_0003B1_0040(0),"I heard that a prisoner escaped from the local 
gaol! Honestly, what is this town coming to...",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0000(0),"I'd thought it might be so, and it seems my 
instincts were correct.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0010(0),"The culprit truly was a follower of Mattias, that 
madman who called himself the Savior.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0020(0),.........,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0030(0),"I worked at Mattias's side, leading such people 
down a path of darkness...",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0040(0),That is why I must atone for my sins.,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0050(0),"...That is true. I can understand why your heart 
and your conscience pain you so.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0060(0),"But I do not think that you trying to shoulder all 
of the blame yourself will help anyone in the 
end.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0070(0),They have turned their eyes to the future.,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0080(0),"They smile and they laugh and they live every 
day as a new day.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0090(0),Perhaps it is time you do the same.,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0100(0),"Allowing yourself to drown in guilt is not 
atonement.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0110(0),"Both you and the people of this village have 
suffered the same wounds.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0120(0),"Yet they have remembered how to smile again. 
I do so wish that you would as well, Lianna.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0130(0),Eliza...,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0140(0),"Yes. Just like that. I've always loved that smile 
of yours, Lianna.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0150(0),...Then I'll try. I'll try to keep smiling for you.,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0160(0),"Now that we've unearthed the villains who 
were hindering our efforts, we can look into 
those ruins at last.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0170(0),"You have been a great aid to us, traveler. Thank 
you.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0180(0),"Yes, truly. Thank you for routing that villain for 
us.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0190(0),"Now Eliza and I can finally begin our 
investigation...and start moving forward.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1(2001),"The people of the village have not been defeated 
by their past. They are living each day to the 
fullest.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0210(0),I'll do the same. I'll keep on smiling.,
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0220(0),"The Knights Ardante should be alert to more 
followers of the dark flame.",
TX_SS_SN1_0006A1_0230(0),"There may still be more of them out there than 
we even realize. We mustn't let our guard down 
yet.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0000(0),"I travel in search of tales and legends of the 
noble dragons, that I might put them down in a 
book.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0010(0),"Or I would. But my master has asked me to 
assist him with his own work...",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0020(0),"So I cannot yet set out to investigate the three 
great dragons of this world.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0030(0),"Could I ask you to perhaps assist me in my 
research?",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0040(0),"I would know about the great dragons found in 
the Frostlands, the Cliftlands, and the Highlands.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0050(0),"I'd be greatly obliged if you could do this for 
me. Really, I would.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0060(0),"My father was a merchant before me and 
traveled his fair share. Even said he saw a 
dragon near here once.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0070(0),"Me, I was born and raised in this town. So I 
know as well as anyone that there are plenty of 
monsters lurking about in these parts.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0080(0),"The mightiest of them all is probably that 
dragon that makes its lair in the cave just 
outside of town.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0090(0),"Once, in an age long lost to us, a wise dragon 
was said to live in the mountains of this land.",
TX_SS_SN3_007200_0100(0),"It was able to speak the words of men, yet it 
wielded a mysterious power beyond that of any 
mortal.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0000(0),"Have you heard about the snowman? He's a 
mysterious creature that lives deep in the 
mountains.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0010(0),"He's covered in fur, but he walks on two feet 
like a man. And he's quite entirely gentle.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0020(0),"He saved me once, when I was lost upon the 
mountain.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0030(0),"But now it seems he has been caught by a man 
who operates a certain kind of show. He 
charges entry to see curiosities of the world.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0040(0),"I wish I could see him back to his mountain, 
where he belongs...",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0050(0),"I make it my job to catch the most rare, the 
most thrilling, the most fantastic of beasts from 
around the world...all for the entertainment and 
delight of others.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0060(0),"Recently I have caught a rare snowman, which I 
will be putting on display soon.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0070(0),"As soon as it has learned some tricks to 
perform, that is...",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0080(0),"If you find any rare thing you think might thrill 
and delight, come and find me. Perhaps we could 
do business.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0090(0),"...Hey, could I tell you something? Just between 
you and me, mind.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0100(0),"See, the truth is...the truth is that I'm a 
werewolf! Every time the moon turns full, I 
can't stop myself from transforming into a wild 
beast!",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0110(0),"It's a curse, to be sure, but...might be a lucrative 
one. Don't you think people might be curious? I 
bet I could earn a pretty penny.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0120(0),"I came to see the snowman they said was a 
part of the show here.",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0130(0),"It looked sad, though. Crying without cease. And 
they were beating it with sticks to try to get it 
perform tricks!",
TX_SS_SN3_007300_0140(0),"That showman is awful... I couldn't bear to 
watch it.",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0000(0),"My house, the great house of Byron, has a 
noble lineage.",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0010(0),"Not that many would know it now to look at us. 
How far we have fallen...",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0020(0),"I even had to part with the precious ring that 
was our family's heirloom. It seems our great 
house will truly end with me.",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0030(0),"You wouldn't believe the deal I got on this ring! 
Oof, that fellow was desperate! Drove him right 
down till he was practically paying me to take it!",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0040(0),"Though I ran into a bit of a rough spot myself 
soon after. Had to sell it off to a peddler of 
such things. Got a better price than what I paid 
for it, at least!",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0050(0),"I've heard stories about that Byron lad. About 
how he mopes about the town, lamenting how 
he's fallen into such disgrace.",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0060(0),"But that is simply the way of the world. The 
gods are fickle, and those who rise up must 
eventually come down.",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0070(0),"I imagine anyone who has studied history could 
tell you that there have been worse reversals 
of fortune in the past. The Byrons can yet 
regain their former glory.",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0080(0),"I've had quite a bit of luck lately. I managed to 
get my hands on a ring said to be the heirloom 
of the very House Byron.",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0090(0),"Got a pretty deal on it. Now it's just up to my 
own skill to piece it out into as many pricey bits 
as I can!",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0100(0),"I am a student of the history of the great 
houses.",
TX_SS_SN3_007400_0110(0),"Needless to say, history is dominated by these 
great and powerful families. To understand 
them is to understand how our realm came to 
be as it is.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0000(0),...That should see you through.,
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0010(0),"If that fever comes back, though, take this twice 
a day till it subsides.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0020(0),"Thank you so much. We're so lucky such a 
skilled apothecary passed through our village.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0030(0),No need for thanks. It's my job is all.,
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0040(0),"Um, sir, if I might ask...",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0050(0),Was I ever your patient before?,
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0060(0),"Not that I remember, but I move about a lot.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0070(0),"I feel like I met you before. Long, long ago.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0080(0),"Could be. Like I said, I move about a lot.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0090(0),"I did stay in this village for a time...earning my 
keep as an apothecary.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0100(0),"But when I lost my wife, I left this place. I was 
on the road for a long time after that.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0110(0),"After all these years, though...I guess the fancy 
just struck me and I thought I'd stop by, see the 
old place.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0120(0),"I'm glad to hear it. I hope you'll stay with us this 
time...forever.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0130(0),.........,
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0140(0),Melyssa...,
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0150(0),Soon it'll be the anniversary of the day I lost you.,
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0160(0),"Is that why my feet brought me back here? Not 
like I've got any right to face you again. If I even 
could...",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0170(0),"I wanted to bring some of my wife's favorite 
flowers to her grave.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0180(0),"But it seems like they don't grow around here 
anymore.",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0190(0),They're called Mind-me-always.,
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0200(0),"Try not to be too surprised when you hear this, 
but I've got some rare blooms in today!",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0210(0),"Look at this fine Mind-me-always! I found just 
this one bloom, high up in the mountains!",
TX_SS_SN3_007500_0220(0),"...Hey, come on! Act at least a little impressed!",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0000(0),"You truly did it? You were able to collect tales 
of the noble dragons for me!?",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0010(0),"Please, you must tell me all that you have 
learned!",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0020(0),...So that is it.,
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0030(0),"Amazing! The dragon of the Cliftlands brought 
down by a single man!",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0040(0),"And that man took on the dragon with no more 
than his bow and his loyal wolf companion...",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0050(0),"It may be that man was one of those beast 
tamers of the Darkwood.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0060(0),"How utterly fascinating... I suppose next would 
be the dragon of the Frostlands, no?",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0070(0),"A dragon that lives deep in the forest, where 
rare herbs flourish?",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0080(0),"It is true that a forest would probably provide a 
good source of foodstuffs, even in the heavy 
snows of the Frostlands.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0090(0),"Perhaps it even chose to live in such a place so 
that it might prey on the animals that come to 
seek those herbs.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0100(0),"Finally the dragon of the Highlands. A dragon 
said to be capable of human speech.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0110(0),"It is like something out of a fairy tale, isn't it? 
Yet there are legends of dragon eggs being 
hatched by men, the young within raised by 
humans...",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0120(0),"And of course there are the legends that claim 
the dragons once lived alongside the gods, and 
were able to use magic.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0130(0),"But they earned themselves the wrath of the 
gods, and the gods left them little more than 
dumb beasts. Or so the tale goes.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0140(0),"Such stories have long persisted, but perhaps 
that is because there is some truth to them.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0150(0),"I thank you. You have gathered a wealth of 
invaluable information for me.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0160(0),"Dragons are rare in our modern world. We 
should at least try to record all that we can 
about them in case they disappear entirely.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0170(0),"The legends and anecdotes that you have 
collected for me will be a great aid in drafting 
my book.",
TX_SS_SN3_0072A0_0180(0),"Thank you very much! I find my hand itching for 
a quill... I cannot wait to get started writing at 
once!",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0000(0),"I...I never meant for things to turn out like this! 
Please...you must return that snowman to the 
mountains!",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0010(0),"Oh, please. You must understand that this a 
business...",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0020(0),"He may be covered in fur, but that snowman 
saved my life!",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0030(0),"He's not some dumb creature for you to put on 
display and force to do tricks!",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0040(0),Rooooaaarrr! Gaaaooohhh!,
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0050(0),"F-fine! Fine, you've convinced me! I will send him 
back to the mountains!",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0060(0),"He was useless at learning tricks anyway, and 
no one wishes to see a creature that does 
nothing but snivel all the time.",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0070(0),Then will you let me take him with me now?,
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0080(0),Tch. Do as you please.,
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0090(0),"Did you hear that, friend? Come with me. Let's 
get you back where you belong!",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0100(0),Aaauuuhhhhhh! Auuuhhh!!!,
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0110(0),"Heh heh heh, that's enough out of you! No need 
to thank me. It's the least I can do.",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0120(0),"Ah, yes, I can more or less guess what this 
fellow is trying to tell me.",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0130(0),Uuuaaahhh!,
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0140(0),"Now it's time I get this one back to the 
mountains where he belongs. Thank you",
TX_SS_SN3_0073A0_0150(0),Aaauuuhhhhhh! Auuuhhh!!!,
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0000(0),And who're you supposed to be?,
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0010(0),"Me? Well...try not to me too frightened when I 
tell you, but... I am a werewolf!",
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0020(0),"A werewolf, you say!? Is that truly so?",
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0030(0),"Once you say it...hmm, yes... You do have quite a 
lot of hair on you, haven't you? And a rather 
wolfish look about your face.",
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0040(0),"Oh yes. When the moon becomes full, my blood 
starts to rage and I turn into a slathering beast.",
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0050(0),"If you'd like, I could even transform in front of 
your visitors.",
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0060(0),"Oh, good. Very, very good! Yes, this has the 
scent of gold about it, or I'm no showman.",
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0070(0),"What's that? The snowman? What need have I 
for a snowman when I could have a <span style=""italic"">wolfman</> 
instead?",
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0080(0),"Yes, I tried to catch it for myself, but it wasn't 
well suited to my kind of show.",
TX_SS_SN3_0073B0_0090(0),"But you! Join my troupe, and I'll feed you three 
good meals a day and let you keep a portion of 
all your earnings!",
TX_SS_SN3_0074A0_0000(0),"That ring you have there! That is my family's 
ring!",
TX_SS_SN3_0074A0_0010(0),"I had no choice but to give it up, such dire 
straits had I found myself in...",
TX_SS_SN3_0074A0_0020(0),"But it has lost none of its brilliance for leaving 
my family...",
TX_SS_SN3_0074A0_0030(0),"Though doubtless it has seen many hands since 
leaving mine own... Many hardships, as well...",
TX_SS_SN3_0074A0_0040(0),"This ring tells me all I need to know. I must be 
the same. I cannot shine the less for 
misfortunes. I cannot let my current situation 
diminish what I am.",
TX_SS_SN3_0074A0_0050(0),"It does not matter how little I have now. I am 
still the heir to the great House Byron.",
TX_SS_SN3_0074A0_0060(0),"Thank you. I will strive to live exhibiting the 
same unflagging beauty as this heirloom of my 
house.",
TX_SS_SN3_0074A0_0070(0),"I cannot be spending all of my time lamenting 
my fate! There is so much that I have to do!",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0000(0),"You say that you researched the history of my 
house? That is a rather curious sort of hobby.",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0010(0),"Yes, we may be fading into disgrace now, but at 
least the glory of our past will live on in 
perpetuity—",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0020(0),...What is that you say?,
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0030(0),"No... No, surely not. But if what you say is true, 
then my great forefathers were...were...lowly 
farmers working the field!?",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0040(0),"They...they managed to raise themselves up 
from such humble beginnings to be one of the 
great houses of the land...?",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0050(0),.........,
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0060(0),"...It would appear that I have been mistaken 
about some things.",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0070(0),"I thought that being born into nobility was a gift 
that was mine by divine right. But I was born 
into such a position because of the hard work 
and sweat of my forebears...",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0080(0),"Effort. Endurance. Patience. That is what House 
Byron should be.",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0090(0),"I shall learn from those who came before me. I 
shall start over from nothing and show that I 
am as worthy as the first Byrons.",
TX_SS_SN3_0074B0_0100(0),"After all...I have nothing more to lose now. I feel 
quite oddly free, in fact!",
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0000(0),This is...a Mind-me-always...,
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0010(0),My wife loved these best of all. Thank you...,
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0020(0),Melyssa... I'm home at last...,
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0030(0),"Remember? How much you loved Mind-me-
always blossoms?",
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0040(0),"I thrust a handful of these at you when I 
proposed to you, standing in that field outside 
the village...",
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0050(0),"You took them, and your smile was brighter 
than the sun...",
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0060(0),.........,
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0070(0),"Not a day has ever passed when I didn't think of 
you...",
TX_SS_SN3_0075A0_0080(0),"I've been wandering all this time, looking for a

precious mineral...",

artistic skill!",

answer still—at least, not one I like.)",
TX_MS_RUD_000200_0190(0),"One thing I do know is that I owe this village a 
debt. A debt I intend to repay.",
TX_MS_RUD_000200_0200(0),"But that's enough brooding for one morning. 
The headman's waiting.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0000(0),"Berg, sir!",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0010(0),"Dawn patrol, sir. Nothing to report!",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0020(0),Good to hear it.,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0030(0),"Two of you today? Usually only one man does 
the rounds.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0040(0),"Aye, sir. Headman thought it best. There's 
brigands in the hills of late.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0050(0),"Poor merchant gutted for his coinpurse just 
yesterday. Was a grisly sight, sir.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0060(0),"These are dangerous times. One can never be 
too careful.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0070(0),I hear the headman is looking for me.,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0080(0),"Ah, he mentioned that, sir. He should still be 
over in the square.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0090(0),"Now if you'll excuse us, sir... Morning patrol, 
resume rounds!",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0100(0),"Ah, Berg. There you are.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0110(0),"Good morning to you, sir.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0120(0),"Morning to you both. Philip said you wanted to 
speak to me.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0130(0),"Yes, yes. I'll get straight to the point. We've had 
reports of bandits in the hills.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0140(0),I see you've doubled the patrols.,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0150(0),Yes... I was also hoping to ask for your aid.,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0160(0),"With bandits lurking, the villagers daren't venture 
into the hills. We cannot check the traps, nor 
collect firewood...",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0170(0),"It's quite the predicament, to say the least.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0180(0),Leave it to me. Where can I find these thieves?,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0190(0),"As for the precise location of their den, I fear I 
cannot say. I sent some of the men out 
searching, but...",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0200(0),"In the meantime, could you put the militia 
through their drills? Our men are keen, but they 
don't know a pommel from a pike, if you get 
my meaning.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0210(0),Consider it done.,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0220(0),"Ah, sir? If 'twould not be a burden, might my 
Philip join in the training?",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0230(0),"If he is willing, so am I.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0240(0),"Oh, he's more than willing, sir, I assure you. 
Been pesterin' me for weeks to ask you!",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0250(0),That's a brave lad!,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0260(0),"The boy has pluck, and ambition. And he could 
find a worse man to look up to than Berg here.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0270(0),"Ever since my husband died...in the war, you 
know...",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0280(0),"It's just...the boy's getting to that age, when he 
needs a father...",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0290(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0300(0),"Oh, no! I did not mean to say—",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0310(0),Your boy is already a credit to the village.,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0320(0),It would be my honor to train him.,
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0330(0),"You are too kind, sir.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0340(0),"It's settled, then. Train the lad well, and see that 
he does his mother proud.",
TX_MS_RUD_000300_0350(0),I will.,
TX_MS_RUD_0004A0_0000(0),"It's no good, sir. We're no match for the likes of 
you!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004A0_0010(0),"You are too hesitant. It is important to protect 
yourself, this is true...",
TX_MS_RUD_0004A0_0020(0),"But you will never win a fight if you lack the 
courage to strike.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004A0_0030(0),"If you say so, sir...",
TX_MS_RUD_0004B0_0000(0),Gah...! Got me again.,
TX_MS_RUD_0004B0_0010(0),"You attack with boldness, but you leave 
yourself open.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004B0_0020(0),"And so a simple counterblow quickly strikes you 
down. You must remember—balance in all 
things.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004B0_0030(0),"Balance, right. I'll try to remember that, sir.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0000(0),"That said, if you fought side by side, you might 
complement each other well.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0010(0),"Was just thinkin' that myself, sir.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0020(0),"Better than the sum of our parts, eh, sir?",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0030(0),"What do you say, friend? Fight side by side?",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0040(0),"Two heads're better than one, eh?",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0050(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0060(0),"Something the matter, sir?",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0070(0),"...What? No, sorry. It's a fine idea. Train together, 
and you will be capable soldiers one day.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0080(0),Sir!,
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0090(0),"The two of us will go on patrol, then, by your 
leave.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C0_0100(0),"Yes, good. If you would.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C1_0000(0),"If so, it's only 'cause we have the best teacher, 
sir!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C1_0010(0),"Do not sell yourselves short. You are strong, 
and skilled with your hands. With some more 
seasoning, you'll be more than a match for any 
bandit.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004C1_0020(0),"Berg, sir, may I spar with you? I'm willin', if not 
quite as able.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004D0_0000(0),"Thought today might be my day... But you're 
just too good for the likes of us, sir.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004D0_0010(0),"Keep at it, friend. The only difference between a 
farmer and a fighter is training.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004D0_0020(0),"'Preciate the kind words, sir, whether they're 
true or not.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004D0_0030(0),"None truer. Though some knights would have 
you believe otherwise.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004D0_0040(0),"So what you're sayin' is, there's hope for me 
yet!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004D0_0050(0),"Just you wait, sir! I'll get the better of you 
afore long!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004D0_0060(0),I look forward to that day.,
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0000(0),"Sir! Me next, please!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0010(0),"You are not ready yet. You need to work on 
your form.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0020(0),Aww.,
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0030(0),"Do the drills as I showed you, and you'll be 
sparring soon enough. You have talent, lad.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0040(0),I do?,
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0050(0),"Not many boys your age take to the sword so 
quickly. And I've trained my share.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0060(0),"Crivens! Th-thank you, sir.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0070(0),"My father... He's, you know...gone, sir. Died in the 
war.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0080(0),...So I've heard.,
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0090(0),"Mother's looked after me ever since. All on her 
own, sir.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0100(0),"But soon...soon I'll be a man grown! And it'll be 
my turn to take care of her!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0110(0),She is a lucky woman to have a son so brave.,
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0120(0),"So you see why I've got to get stronger, sir!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0130(0),"I have to protect Mother, and everyone in the 
village. After all she's done for me, I owe her 
that much!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0140(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0150(0),"(I, too, once had someone to protect...)",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0160(0),Sir?,
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0170(0),"It's nothing, lad. Just old memories. Keep at your 
training, and you'll be a strong man before long.",
TX_MS_RUD_0004E0_0180(0),"I will, sir!",
TX_MS_RUD_0004F0_0000(0),(Mayhap I should make a round of the village.),
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0000(0),Aaaaaaaaahhh!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0010(0),Brigands! We're under attack!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0014(0),...!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0015(0),"B-Berg, sir!",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0016(0),Brigands at the village gates!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0017(0),Brigands from the hills!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0020(0),Bah! These dirty peasants don't know their place!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0030(0),We outnumber 'em! Surround 'em!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0040(0),"Stick a blade in their backs 'fore the boss finds 
out swineherds slowed us down!",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0050(0),"Do your worst, you brutes!",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0060(0),You'll not be getting past us!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0070(0),Damn it all! These swineherds know how to fight!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0080(0),Sir!,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0090(0),"Good work, men. You did well to hold them off.",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0100(0),...But I'll take over from here.,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0110(0),"And who in the hells are <span style=""italic"">you</> supposed to be?",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0120(0),He's a bleedin' fool if he thinks he can take us all.,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0130(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0140(0),"So ye's got a fancy blade, eh? I know yer sort, 
hedge knight. I've cut down my share o' yer 
betters.",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0150(0),"Oi! Be on yer guard, now. He looks like he 
knows how to use that blade.",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0160(0),What of it? I ain't afraid o' the likes of him.,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0170(0),I'm tellin' ye...this one's trouble.,
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0180(0),"You both have the right of it. I'm but a common 
hedge knight, with no name to speak of.",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0190(0),"But if you've come looking for trouble...you've 
found it.",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0200(0),"Stow it, or I'll cut out yer tongue!",
TX_MS_RUD_000500_0210(0),Enough prattle! Let's skewer 'im!,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0000(0),You...,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0010(0),"Ye can handle a blade, aye. But this ain't the end 
o' it.",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0020(0),"When the boss hears 'bout this, yer a dead man, 
ye hear?",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0030(0),"We'll see about that, won't we?",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0040(0),Help! My boy!,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0050(0),"Let me go, you ugly—ngh!",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0060(0),Hm!?,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0070(0),"Oh, Berg, sir! They...they took him from me!",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0080(0),"My poor Philip... He was trying to protect me, 
but those...those animals...!",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0090(0),Damn it all!,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0100(0),"Forgive me, sir... There were so many of them, 
and—",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0110(0),It doesn't matter now! We have to save the lad!,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0120(0),"We know where they are now. Holed up in a 
cave, deep in the mountains.",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0130(0),"Then let's go! Gods only know what they'll do to 
him...",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0140(0),...Wait.,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0150(0),"But, sir! We have to do something! They might 
kill the boy!",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0160(0),"If you leave now, who will protect the village 
when the thieves return?",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0170(0),No...you would be playing right into their hands.,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0180(0),"...Gods a'mercy. Is there nothing we can do, sir?",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0190(0),I'll go after the boy.,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0200(0),"Alone!? But, sir, even you...!",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0210(0),"You stay and guard the village. At least until 
you're sure they're not coming back.",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0220(0),...Chief?,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0230(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0240(0),"You are the boy's—<span style=""italic"">our</> only hope. Can you do 
this, Berg?",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0250(0),Consider it done.,
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0260(0),"Please, sir! Bring him back safe!",
TX_MS_RUD_000600_0270(0),You have my word.,
TX_MS_RUD_000605_0000(0),"Berg, sir! The brigands are holed up in yonder 
cave.",
TX_MS_RUD_000605_0010(0),"It's surely most dangerous, sir. Best prepare 
well afore settin' out.",
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0000(0),"Look who's come. Have ye lost somethin', 
hedge knight?",
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0010(0),"Move aside, before I cut you in two.",
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0020(0),"Ye have courage, I'll give ye that. Just who are 
ye, anyway?",
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0030(0),"Never seen no hedge knight swing a blade the 
way ye do.",
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0040(0),"Then you'll step aside, if you know what's good 
for you.",
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0050(0),"You're on our land now, hedge knight. We give 
the orders here.",
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0060(0),"Ye have skill, but ye're a man like any other, and 
ye'll bleed as red.",
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0070(0),Get 'im!,
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0080(0),Get 'im!,
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0090(0),Get 'im!,
TX_MS_RUD_0006A0_0100(0),Get 'im!,
TX_MS_RUD_0006B0_0000(0),"(Be strong, lad. I'm coming for you.)",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0000(0),"Do tell me about this friend of yours. Knows 
how to fight, does he?",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0010(0),H-he sure does!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0020(0),"He's stronger than all of you put together! You 
won't stand a chance!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0030(0),Stronger'n all of us?,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0033(0),That's a laugh!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0037(0),The boy's daft!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0040(0),I-it's not a joke! Stop laughing!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0050(0),"Ye hear that, mates? This hedge knight's the 
strongest blade in the realm!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0060(0),"Gwahahaha! If he thinks he can best all of us, 
he's more madman than knight!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0070(0),"This ain't a fairy tale, boy. Real knights don't 
piddle away their days in the company of 
swineherds.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0080(0),"If he's a knight from the stories, a damsel in 
distress might serve as better bait. Reckon we 
should go back for the mum?",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0090(0),Wahahaha!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0093(0),Now there's a plan!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0097(0),I'll drink to that!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0100(0),"S-stop it! You won't be laughing when Sir Berg 
is through with you!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0110(0),"Sir Berg! Now there's a frightenin' name! Look, 
me arm's all a'tremblin'!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0120(0),"Shut up, all of you!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0130(0),...Boss?,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0140(0),"Reckon the boy's got more courage than the lot 
of you—an' more wits, to boot.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0150(0),"So less yammerin', and more sharpenin' your 
stabbers!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0160(0),"B-but, Boss. Ain't no way the hedge knight'll 
follow us here. 'Less he's mad an' all.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0170(0),"Aye. It ain't like it's his own son or nothin'. Why 
should he care?",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0180(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0190(0),"Why, indeed? Things could get interestin' though, 
if he does show.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0200(0),"Always had a soft spot for men with more 
courage than sense.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0210(0),Heh...,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0220(0),Like the boy here...,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0230(0),"What do you say, laddie? Care to join our little 
family? We're always lookin' for men with pluck.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0240(0),"I'll never join you! I'm going to be a brave 
warrior...like Sir Berg!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0250(0),"Ahahaha! You hear that, men? The boy says he's 
too good for banditry!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0260(0),"Think you're the only one who feels that way, 
boy? Let me tell you somethin'—",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0270(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0280(0),"What is it, Boss?",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0290(0),Sir!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0300(0),"Sorry I'm late, lad. Got held up along the way.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0310(0),"'Ey, look! It's the mighty Sir Berg, in the flesh!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0320(0),"He <span style=""italic"">is</> mad! An' how'd he get in here, anyway!? 
Where are the lookouts?",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0330(0),"Bleeding in the dirt, last I saw.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0340(0),Bwahahahaha!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0350(0),...!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0360(0),Sir!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0370(0),Stay back!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0380(0),D-did he just—? He parried the boss's blow!,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0390(0),"Hang me, but I ain't never seen no one do that 
afore...",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0400(0),"You're quick, all right...and strong.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0410(0),"Clearly no common hedge knight, are you?",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0420(0),Just as you are no common brigand.,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0430(0),That blade...,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0440(0),"Like it, do you? It just so happens to be a 
present...from an old friend.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0450(0),...Erhardt!?,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0460(0),"Oho! You know the man, do you now?",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0470(0),So it is his blade.,
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0480(0),"As if I needed another reason to cut you down 
where you stand...!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0490(0),"How do you know Erhardt, rogue...? Speak, or I'll 
slice your throat!",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0500(0),"Hah! Ye've got a score to settle, is that it?",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0510(0),"I can see it in your eyes. They blazed like fire 
when you said his name.",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0520(0),"Look, I don't know what passed between you 
and Erhardt...",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0530(0),"But if you're lookin' to ask questions of me, my 
good sir...",
TX_MS_RUD_000700_0540(0),...You'll have to earn the right!,
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0000(0),I...I yield.,
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0010(0),"Now I will have my answers. How do you know 
Erhardt?",

Helped me out, showed me the ropes.",
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0040(0),A sellsword... And where is he now?,

we went our separate ways.",
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0060(0),"After that, I drifted from one town to the next. 
Tried one trade, then another. But swingin' a 
blade's the only thing that's ever come natural 
to me.",

make a living.",
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0080(0),"Anyone could use a sword arm like yours. You 
could protect the people, instead of stealing 
from them.",

than the gods saw fit to bless me with.",
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0100(0),"Never meant to do anyone no harm... But life 
doesn't always give us a choice in the matter, 
does it?",

TX_MS_RUD_000800_0120(0),"Aye, I know the score. But I've got my men to 
think about, too.",

of it.",

Live by the sword, and...",

up to what he's done.",

Surrender, and I will see that you and your men 
are not harmed.",

do you one in return...",

don't.",

back in the mercenary band.",
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0240(0),You should find him in Victors Hollow.,
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0250(0),And this man will tell me where Erhardt is?,
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0260(0),"He might. Then again, he might not.",
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0270(0),"Still, if you want to find him that much, I reckon 
it's worth tryin'.",

to life.",

Eisenberg, the Unbending Blade.",

TX_MS_RUD_000800_0383(0),What in—!?,

today.",
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0430(0),"Is it true, sir? Are you...a real knight?",
TX_MS_RUD_000800_0440(0),"Long ago, lad. Long ago.",

We can protect our home, at the very least.",

me wrong yet.",

didn't—tourney fighters don't make a habit of 
fraternizing with the hoi polloi.",

thing. But something tells me he's not expecting 
your visit.",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0200(0),...Do you have a point?,
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0210(0),"I have advice. If you want to talk to Gustav, 
your best play would be to fight in the tourney 
yourself.",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0220(0),,
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0230(0),"But how? The preliminary rounds are already 
over, or so I heard.",

you can get around that.",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0250(0),Then tell me.,
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0260(0),"Simply prove that you're a better fighter than 
one of the remaining champions—and make 
sure everyone sees it.",

TX_MS_RUD_010100_0280(0),"During the tourney, local authorities turn a blind 
eye to public dueling. It's still against the law, 
mind you, but no one gets in trouble for it.",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0290(0),"Lots of men come here fancying themselves 
good with a blade. And they look to prove it, 
whether they qualify for the tourney or no.",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0300(0),"But surely, those who have qualified are above 
getting involved in petty brawls.",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0310(0),"They're here to prove 'emselves, same as 
everyone. If the circumstances're right, they can 
no more shirk a challenge outside the arena 
than in it.",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0320(0),"I'm telling you, this is your ticket to the tourney. 
Get the attention of one of the champions—and 
make them challenge you.",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0330(0),"Put them in a position where they've no choice 
but to prove they're your better with a blade.",

TX_MS_RUD_010100_0350(0),"When you <span style=""italic"">do</> get into the tourney, you'll fight 
under my colors. If you reach the final battle, I'll 
have fighters linin' up to put their seal on a 
contract with me.",

TX_MS_RUD_010100_0370(0),"Is there a better kind? I'll get my scribe to draw 
up the contract. What name will you use?",
TX_MS_RUD_010100_0380(0),My own. Olberic Eisenberg.,

could pick 'em, Ned.",

to work out handsomely.",
TX_MS_RUD_0101A0_0000(0),"Well, now. Which of these hot-blooded types

TX_MS_RUD_0102D0_0120(0),"No. But I like it not when my fate is in another's 
hand...",
TX_MS_RUD_0102D0_0130(0),Cuds me! It's Victorino!,

the heads of seven ill-famed buccaneers!?",

TX_MS_RUD_010800_0060(0),...I'm listening.,
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0070(0),"Now, where to begin...",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0080(0),"Tell me, Sir Olberic. Are you familiar with the 
land from which Sir Erhardt hailed?",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0090(0),"Some border town in the far reaches of 
Hornburg...or so he once told me.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0100(0),"Aye. A peaceful village called Grynd—at least it 
was, till it was razed in the war.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0110(0),...!,
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0120(0),"'Twas long before Lord Erhardt became a knight 
that he lost his home.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0130(0),"After that, he joined a band of sellswords for a 
spell. It was there he got an idea in his head.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0140(0),"And so he finally came to serve Hornburg and 
the crown...as a spy.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0150(0),"Preposterous! You mean to tell me that Erhardt 
meant to betray us all along!?",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0160(0),"His eyes always burned with fire when he told 
the tale. ""The king of Hornburg turned his back 
on us,"" he'd said, ""and sat on his ass as our 
homes burned.""",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0170(0),"Nonsense! King Alfred cared for all his subjects! 
He would never—",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0180(0),"Lord Erhardt claimed otherwise. Either way, he 
was a man on a mission.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0190(0),"If that's true... That means he'd been plotting the 
downfall of Hornburg for years!",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0200(0),"Revenge is made all the sweeter by the passage 
of time. How sweet it must have been for him, 
when Hornburg fell at last.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0210(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0220(0),"I don't pretend to admire his deeds, nor claim 
they are honorable...",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0230(0),"But then, I've never known the pain and anguish 
Sir Erhardt was forced to bear.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0240(0),"Though I wonder, sometimes, how it made him 
feel to see justice done. If winning his revenge 
put his heart at ease.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0250(0),"I never asked him, an' he never told me. But of 
all the men in this world, mayhap he'd tell you.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0260(0),You look up to the man...don't you?,
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0270(0),"He taught me to be a true warrior. And I 
daresay he was a friend as well.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0280(0),"I know of little else but the ways of battle. 
Whatever his sins might've been, I was proud to 
call him a brother.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0290(0),As was I... Thank you.,
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0300(0),"Happy to have the company, and a willing ear.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0310(0),"You'll find Sir Erhardt in the desert town of 
Wellspring.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0320(0),"When you do...well, I trust you'll do what's right.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0330(0),"Even if that means I slay him? Your friend, your 
mentor, your brother...",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0340(0),"If that is what you believe he deserves, I reckon 
he'll accept his fate. And so will I.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0350(0),"Whatever the cause he fought for, it does not 
excuse his deeds. He slew the king he had taken 
a sworn oath to protect.",
TX_MS_RUD_010800_0360(0),"I will listen to what he has to say. That much I 
can promise you. But no more.",
TX_MS_RUD_0108A0_0000(0),"(Does Gustav have the right of it? Did Erhardt 
wield his sword for the sake of revenge?)",
TX_MS_RUD_0108A0_0010(0),"(If so, does he still wield it, even though the 
thirst for vengeance has been sated?)",
TX_MS_RUD_0108A0_0020(0),"(Could it be that we are the same? Has Erhardt, 
too, lost his purpose?)",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0000(0),Hey! Where're you running off to!?,
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0010(0),"What does it matter? The tourney is over. Our 
bargain is concluded.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0020(0),"It is. But that doesn't mean we can't bid each 
other godspeed.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0030(0),"Phew, caught ye in the nick o' time. We won't let 
ye go sneakin' away without so much as a fare-
thee-well.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0040(0),Of course. Pray forgive my manners.,
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0050(0),"I could not have gotten this far without 
you...both of you. You have my thanks.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0060(0),"And you have ours. So, if I can be so bold, 
where're you off to next?",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0070(0),The Sunlands. A town called Wellspring.,
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0080(0),To finish what I started here.,
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0090(0),And then?,
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0100(0),"...I don't know. Perhaps I'll return ho—
...To the village I came from before here.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0110(0),"Well, if you've already got a place to call home, 
then maybe this means nothing...",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0120(0),"But if you're looking for a new line of work, 
you could do worse than being a full-time 
champion.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0130(0),"The offer is welcome, but it's not the life for 
me...",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0140(0),"Thought you might say that. But I had to ask, eh?",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0150(0),"If ye ever have a change of heart, just drop on 
by. Or even if ye don't—ye'll always be 
welcome here...",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0160(0),"Thank you, friend. I may do just that. In the 
meantime, take care of those wounds.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0170(0),"Don't you worry about me. I'll be fightin' fit 
soon enough, an' ready to give a good showin' 
at next year's tourney.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0180(0),"A <span style=""italic"">good</> <span style=""italic"">showing</>? Now there's an inspiring goal. 
If you want to stick around in my stable, I'll see 
you claim the throne!",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0190(0),"Oi, oi! One step at a time, m'lady. I ain't the 
Unbendin' Blade o' Hornburg, after all!",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0200(0),A title and a crest do not a swordsman make.,
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0210(0),"Aye, true enough. Maybe I <span style=""italic"">will</> go an' win it all. 
See what the bettors'll say about that!",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0220(0),"Tell ye what—if they crown Ned king, ye come 
back and we'll put on a duel the likes of which 
the city's never seen.",
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0230(0),I'd like that very much.,
TX_MS_RUD_010900_0240(0),"But today the road calls. Till our paths cross 
again, my friends.",
TX_NA_RUD_010900_0000(0),And so did Olberic leave Victors Hollow behind him,
TX_NA_RUD_010900_0005(0),with new knowledge of Erhardt's past and present.,
TX_NA_RUD_010900_0010(0),,
TX_NA_RUD_010900_0020(0),"Now Olberic must find Erhardt, and, gods willing, the truth...",
TX_NA_RUD_010900_0030(0),even if it means crossing blades with his erstwhile friend.,
TX_NA_RUD_010900_0035(0),,
TX_NA_RUD_010900_0040(0),"And so to the Sunlands, and the desert oasis of Wellspring.",
TX_NA_RUD_010900_0050(0),Olberic's journey continues...,
TX_NA_RUD_020000_0000(0),– The Story So Far –,
TX_NA_RUD_020000_0010(0),"And so Olberic triumphed in the arena at Victors Hollow,",
TX_NA_RUD_020000_0020(0),defeating Gustav the Black Knight in an epic struggle.,

TX_NA_RUD_020000_0035(0),"a tale of a home lost while a king sat idly by,",
TX_NA_RUD_020000_0040(0),and of how Erhardt swore vengeance upon the crown.,

TX_NA_RUD_020010_0025(0),,
TX_NA_RUD_020010_0030(0),Olberic sought answers to these questions—,
TX_NA_RUD_020010_0040(0),—answers he knew would come only after a clash of blades.,
TX_NA_RUD_020010_0045(0),,
TX_NA_RUD_020010_0050(0),And so did Olberic arrive in Wellspring...,
TX_MS_RUD_020000_0000(0),(Erhardt's somewhere in this town.),
TX_MS_RUD_020000_0010(0),(Best start asking around.),

TX_MS_RUD_0200A0_0010(0),"Erhardt... You'd be lookin' for the swordsman 
then.",
TX_MS_RUD_0200A0_0020(0),So you know the man.,
TX_MS_RUD_0200A0_0030(0),"Aye, and know him well. We all do. For the debt 
we owe him.",
TX_MS_RUD_0200A0_0040(0),Debt?,
TX_MS_RUD_0200A0_0050(0),"Aye. See, this town is plagued by damned 
lizardmen.",
TX_MS_RUD_0200A0_0060(0),"Time was, they were happy to skulk about in 
their lairs and leave us well enough alone. But 
then they took to settin' upon travelers headin' 
to and fro.",
TX_MS_RUD_0200A0_0070(0),"A fine mess it was, till Erhardt came along an' 
started takin' care of them for us.",
TX_MS_RUD_0200A0_0080(0),So where is he now?,

Unbending Blade of Hornburg—a realm that fell 
some years ago.",

TX_MS_RUD_020700_0080(0),"Hah, that so! How was the scoundrel? Still in one 
piece?",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0090(0),"He was well. Fighting for his keep. He told me 
about Grynd...your hometown.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0100(0),"Sounds like you had a grand old chat. Did he tell 
you about the soldiers who burned it to the 
ground?",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0110(0),"Tough world this, for a young lad without a 
home. When the band of sellswords picked me 
up, I was grateful for it.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0120(0),"And when the boss told me he wanted my help 
to bring down Hornburg... Well, suffice to say he 
didn't need to ask twice.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0130(0),You wanted revenge.,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0140(0),"Aye. Against the king who did naught as the only 
home I'd ever known was reduced to ash and 
rubble.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0150(0),"Even at the end, as the flames licked the roof 
beams of their homes...my family, my friends 
believed the king would save them.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0160(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0170(0),"I swore then and there I would never forgive 
King Alfred! That he'd pay for what he'd 
done—or <span style=""italic"">not</> done, as it were.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0180(0),"And so I came to Hornburg and became a knight. 
Served my commanders faithfully, worked my 
way up in the ranks—but then, you know that 
story, don't you?",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0190(0),All the while biding your time to that final battle...,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0200(0),"Delivered my revenge at the point of my blade, 
even as the king looked into my eyes.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0210(0),...His Majesty was a courageous man.,

anguish, the pain, the despair...",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0260(0),"But it gave me nothing. No release, no triumph... 
Only a hollowness, a cold, empty void where my 
rage once burned.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0270(0),"As I searched for something to hold on to, the 
memories that came to me were not of my 
lost home...but of the years I'd spent as a knight, 
with my brothers-in-arms...with you.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0280(0),Did you regret it?,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0290(0),"Regret it? Aye, I certainly did. I regretted living a 
lie for all those years in the name of vengeance.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0300(0),"And yet, though they were a lie... A strange 
thing, isn't it? The memories of those days are 
as real as anything I have.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0310(0),"Those days in Hornburg. The barracks, the 
proving grounds, the jousting lists...",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0320(0),"But anyhow, we disbanded after that and went 
our separate ways. We'd accomplished our aim, 
but were left homeless, masterless...",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0330(0),"My wanderings brought me to Wellspring. A 
town like a hundred others I'd seen before.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0340(0),"And yet you stayed, and now protect its people 
from harm.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0350(0),Aye...,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0360(0),"Draw your blade, Erhardt.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0370(0),"You don't have to do this, Olberic.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0380(0),I can end it for you. All of it.,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0390(0),"Your anger, your pain, your regret... This lie 
your life has become...",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0400(0),"I'll cut you down and give you the peace you 
seek.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0410(0),"My king dead, and my countrymen... What did 
that make me, who had sworn my very life to 
protect them? For what did I wield my sword? 
Gods, how many years did that question plague 
me?",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0420(0),"But at long last I understood... I'd never lost my 
worth.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0430(0),"Like you, I bear my sword so that I may protect 
others.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0440(0),"Erhardt... I cannot stand here, and pretend to 
understand what caused you to do as you did.",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0450(0),"And though I search my heart, I find no room 
there for forgiveness. I find only...",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0460(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0470(0),I should have bested you that day.,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0480(0),"Victory should have been mine! Then, and only 
then could I have saved our liege—and you, 
from the monster you would become!",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0490(0),"Hear me, Erhardt!",

TX_MS_RUD_020700_0530(0),Haha...ha...,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0540(0),"I could tell you to learn from my mistakes. But 
then, what right have I?",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0550(0),"Nay, we'll do it your way. No holdin' back, eh, old 
friend?",
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0560(0),I would not have it any other way.,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0570(0),So be it!,
TX_MS_RUD_020700_0580(0),"In victory, truth!",

TX_MS_RUD_020800_0060(0),...,
TX_MS_RUD_020800_0070(0),"Tell me one thing, Erhardt.",

TX_MS_RUD_020800_0130(0),This is the cause you've found?,
TX_MS_RUD_020800_0140(0),Just so.,

TX_MS_RUD_020800_0220(0),Where can I find him?,
TX_MS_RUD_020800_0230(0),"After the fall of Hornburg, he set off for 
Riverford.",
TX_MS_RUD_020800_0240(0),"After that, the gods only know what became of 
him.",
TX_MS_RUD_020800_0250(0),"That's all I need to know. Men like that leave a 
trail, whether they mean to or not.",
TX_MS_RUD_020800_0260(0),Reckon they do.,
TX_MS_RUD_020800_0270(0),Until someone stops them in their tracks...,
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0000(0),You're alive! And Lord Erhardt?,
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0010(0),See for yourself.,
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0020(0),"Took some doing, but we slew the leaders of 
the horde.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0030(0),"Once your men finish off the stragglers, you'll 
have nothing more to fear from that nest.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0040(0),"Did you hear that, lads!? Erhardt slew their 
leaders!",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0050(0),"Couldn't have done it had Olberic not shown up 
in the nick of time.",

side by side? Hang me if it ain't like a storybook!",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0070(0),"You have our undying gratitude, Sir Olberic!",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0080(0),I do not warrant it. What I did was for myself.,
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0090(0),"And now the time has come for me to seek out 
a new cause in another place.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0100(0),"Olberic, I—",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0110(0),You would remain here. I know.,
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0120(0),I'm sorry...,
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0130(0),Do not be.,
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0140(0),"But before you go, let me say one more thing. If 
you mean to go up against Werner, watch your 
back.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0150(0),How so?,
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0160(0),"I've never seen anyone swing a blade like he 
does. It's more than just strength and 
skill—there's something about him that strikes 
fear into men's hearts.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0170(0),"You are stronger now, Olberic. Stronger than 
me, I daresay. If your will is strong, you are 
doubtless the measure of him.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0180(0),"But make no mistake—you would be well-
advised to fear him.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0190(0),"Coming from you, Erhardt, that is warning 
indeed. I will heed your words.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0200(0),"And now I must go. When this is over, mayhap 
we shall meet again.",
TX_MS_RUD_020900_0210(0),I look forward to that day...old friend.,
TX_NA_RUD_020900_0000(0),And so did Olberic leave Wellspring behind him.,

mother's grave!",
TX_MS_RUD_030000_0110(0),"Of course it ain't. I'd suggest ye confess yer

opposition.",

you.",

us, Sir Olberic?",

square, and draw as many of Werner's men as 
we can.",

lord's mansion, by way of a secret passage

in revolution and war. Prepare as you will, then 
come to me again when you are ready to fight.",

TX_MS_ALI_030900_0025(0),"Hoho, I suppose I should introduce myself.",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0030(0),"I dedicated many years of my life to creating 
something...",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0040(0),"Something that became a precious treasure to 
you.",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0050(0),"You mean...<span style=""italic"">you</> made that notebook!?",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0060(0),"Mm-hmm. The writer was someone else, 
though.",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0070(0),I gave it to him a good ten years ago.,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0080(0),Went by the name Graham Crossford.,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0090(0),Graham Crossford...,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0095(0),"So he's the one whose travels I've been reading 
about.",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0100(0),That's right. That man saved my life.,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0110(0),He was just about to head off on a journey.,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0120(0),He didn't know where his travels would take him.,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0130(0),"So I told him he ought to keep a record of 
where he'd been.",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0140(0),I spent forty odd years making notebooks.,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0150(0),"But there wasn't anyone else's journey I wanted 
to hear about as much as his.",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0160(0),Writing in a diary comes from the heart...,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0170(0),"And there was no one with a heart as great as 
his.",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0180(0),"When you spoke about your own travels, I 
thought I saw some of him in you.",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0190(0),It was like you were in love with that notebook.,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0200(0),...,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0210(0),,
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0220(0),"If you ever meet Graham, could you tell him 
something for me?",
TX_MS_ALI_030900_0230(0),"I've got another diary for him, just waiting to be 
filled.",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0000(0),"So, what are you going to do now?",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0010(0),Hmm...,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0020(0),I think I'll go back home.,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0030(0),I've experienced so many things on this journey.,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0040(0),"It was filled with so many moments that can't 
be contained in a diary.",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0050(0),"I traveled and traded across the land and met 
amazing people along the way.",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0060(0),"And when I stood on that stage, I realized...",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0070(0),I did what I set out to do.,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0080(0),...,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0090(0),...I want to tell my parents that.,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0100(0),I can't wait to see the look on their faces.,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0110(0),"Home, huh...",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0120(0),"How about you, Ali?",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0130(0),"It's probably time for me to head home, too.",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0140(0),My father is waiting for me.,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0150(0),"I finally saved up enough money for him to 
open up shop again.",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0160(0),"So, who's the better merchant between you 
two?",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0170(0),I'd like to think I am.,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0180(0),"Hey, Tressa.",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0190(0),Yeah?,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0200(0),Next time we meet...,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0210(0),"We'll see who's the better merchant, right?",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0220(0),"Wrong. Next time... I hope you're a little more 
refined.",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0230(0),What!?,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0240(0),"See, you're like a skystone...",
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0250(0),One that could use a bit more polishing.,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0260(0),Hey!,
TX_MS_ALI_031000_0270(0),"Hehe. See you around, Tressa.",
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0000(0),,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0010(0),,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0020(0),,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0030(0),Now then...,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0040(0),My journey isn't over yet.,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0045(0),I'll be there soon.,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0050(0),,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0060(0),,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0070(0),That was how I met Tressa.,
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0080(0),"She gave me this diary to fill with my own 
memories.",
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0090(0),"I know that somewhere out there, she's 
bringing happiness to others just as she did to 
me.",
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0100(0),"And someday, I hope to follow in her footsteps.",
TX_MS_ALI_0310A0_0110(0),– Noa Wyndham,
TX_MS_THE_000000_0000(0),"...And so it was that Atlasdam was founded 
some two centuries ago.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0010(0),"Indeed, our fair city-state is among the longest-
standing on the continent of Orsterra.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0020(0),"But there was another city-state with a history 
as long and proud as our own that came to a 
tragic ruin only eight short years ago.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0030(0),"Now, who can tell me its name? How about you, 
Therese?",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0040(0),"I, um... I think it was...",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0050(0),"Now, now. No need to get all flustered.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0060(0),"There's no shame in not knowing an answer, so 
long as you have a desire to learn.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0070(0),"The answer is in your textbook. Go on, now. 
Look it up.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0080(0),"Yes, Professor...",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0090(0),Let's see...,
TX_MS_THE_000000_0100(0),...,
TX_MS_THE_000000_0110(0),I believe it was...Hornburg?,
TX_MS_THE_000000_0120(0),That is correct!,
TX_MS_THE_000000_0130(0),"Hornburg was ruled over by a royal family said 
to be descended from priests of an ancient and 
long-forgotten religion.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0140(0),"On the other hand, our fair Atlasdam was 
founded by one of the original clans that 
inhabited the Flatlands.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0150(0),"Who can tell me how many clans lived in the 
Flatlands at the time? ...Your Highness?",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0160(0),"The histories have it that eight clans did live in 
the Flatlands in those days.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0170(0),"Correct you are, Your Highness!",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0180(0),"It was a time of great strife here in the 
Flatlands, as the eight clans waged a long and 
bitter war.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0190(0),"Change would come when the armies of 
Grandport invaded these lands some two 
centuries ago.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0200(0),"At the time, the rulers of Grandport sought to 
exert their influence over territories inland.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0210(0),"Ironically, this compelled the warring tribes to 
put aside their differences and unite against 
their common foe.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0220(0),"...Oh, but look at the time! We'll pick up where 
we left off next time.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0230(0),"Don't forget to read chapters three and four 
before our next lecture...",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0240(0),"...and be prepared to answer questions on any 
of the material within.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0250(0),"Yes, Professor.",
TX_MS_THE_000000_0260(0),"Thank you for another most stimulating lecture, 
Professor Albright.",
TX_MS_THE_0001A0_0000(0),"Ah, Professor Albright. Mercedes from the Royal 
Library came by with a message for you.",
TX_MS_THE_0001A0_0010(0),"Seems today's your lucky day. You've been 
granted permission to enter the special archives.",
TX_MS_THE_0001A0_0020(0),Splendid! Finally I can begin my research.,
TX_MS_THE_0001A0_0030(0),"(The library is just outside the palace. I'd best 
make haste.)",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0000(0),...,
TX_MS_THE_000100_0010(0),Profess—!,
TX_MS_THE_000100_0020(0),Professor Albright!,
TX_MS_THE_000100_0030(0),!?,
TX_MS_THE_000100_0040(0),"Oh, thank heavens you're still here. I thought I 
had missed you.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0050(0),"What can I do for you, Your Highness?",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0060(0),"If you can spare the time, I had a question about 
something we learned today.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0070(0),"But of course, Your Highness. It would be my 
pleasure to answer anything.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0080(0),"After all, my role as your tutor is as important 
to me as any of my research.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0090(0),"Unfortunately, I cannot spare much time. Is the 
question a quick one?",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0100(0),"Yes, Professor. It will not take long.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0110(0),"I was just wondering about the ancient religion 
of Hornburg. Pray tell, what did they worship?",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0120(0),"A very astute question, Your Highness.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0130(0),"However, I fear that nearly all the texts detailing 
the nature of the religion were burned and lost 
when Hornburg fell.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0140(0),"I see. A shame, that.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0150(0),"I do, however, have a theory of my own...",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0160(0),"I believe that the royal family of Hornburg were 
guardians of an ancient power...",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0170(0),"Mind you, this is not idle speculation. My theory 
is based on the fact that—",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0180(0),...,
TX_MS_THE_000100_0190(0),"Let us continue the discussion another time. My 
apologies for keeping you, Professor.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0200(0),"No need for apologies! And it would be my 
pleasure, Your Highness.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0210(0),"That such questions occur to you is a sign of a 
sharp and curious mind.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0220(0),"Your lectures on the history of the realm are 
most fascinating to me.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0230(0),"For if I do not learn of our past, how can I hope 
to lead my people to a bright future?",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0240(0),"A most admirable philosophy, Your Highness.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0250(0),"The people of this land are truly fortunate to be 
led by one of such wisdom and kindness.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0260(0),"...As I am truly fortunate to have the 
opportunity to serve in some small way.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0270(0),"You are far too kind, Professor Albright. I am 
proud to be your student.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0280(0),"...Oh dear, I'm running late.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0290(0),"Pray do not forget your assignment, Your 
Highness.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0300(0),"Of course, Professor.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0310(0),"Oh, hello there, Therese.",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0320(0),Did you have a question for me as well?,
TX_MS_THE_000100_0330(0),"I... I mean, no... Good day, Professor...",
TX_MS_THE_000100_0340(0),...?,
TX_MS_THE_0001C0_0000(0),"Ah, Professor. Heading into town?",
TX_MS_THE_0001C0_0010(0),"Just so! I was just on my way to the library to 
do a bit of research.",
TX_MS_THE_0001C0_0020(0),"But of course. You'll find it just outside to the 
east of he—er, sorry, Professor. Of course you 
know this already.",
TX_MS_THE_0001C0_0030(0),"No need for apologies, my good man. Your 
passion for your job is most admirable! And 
with that, I bid you good day.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0000(0),"Good day, Mercedes. Cyrus Albright, here to 
browse the special archives.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0010(0),"Oh, Professor Albright. You're looking quite 
eager today.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0020(0),"When I heard that an original copy of <span style=""italic"">The</> 
<span style=""italic"">Church</> <span style=""italic"">of</> <span style=""italic"">the</> <span style=""italic"">Flame:</> <span style=""italic"">A</> <span style=""italic"">Complete</> <span style=""italic"">Historie</> had 
been donated to our archives, I simply had to be 
the first to see it.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0030(0),"You're more on top of our collection than I am. 
Just sign here...",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0040(0),With pleasure!,
TX_MS_THE_000200_0050(0),Heh...,
TX_MS_THE_000200_0060(0),Hm? Is something amiss?,
TX_MS_THE_000200_0070(0),"For someone known as the most brilliant mind 
in the Royal Academy...",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0080(0),"When you talk about books, you're as giddy as a 
schoolboy.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0090(0),"Haha! When you put it that way, yes. Much as a 
child is fascinated by a new toy...",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0100(0),"I am titillated by the prospect of acquiring new 
knowledge.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0110(0),Right. The expression on your face says it all.,
TX_MS_THE_000200_0120(0),"Anyway, everything seems to be in order. Enjoy 
your quest for knowledge, Professor.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0130(0),"Many thanks, my dear! I most certainly will.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0140(0),(How odd. The tome is nowhere to be found.),
TX_MS_THE_000200_0150(0),"(Did someone return it to the wrong shelf? 
Hmm, not here either...)",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0160(0),"(These archives are strictly guarded and 
curated. Wherever could it have gone...?)",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0170(0),"Professor Albright, the headmaster would see 
you at once.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0180(0),"Of all the times to... Oh well. Might I ask of you a 
favor?",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0190(0),What might that be?,
TX_MS_THE_000200_0200(0),"The tome I mentioned before seems to have 
gone missing. Could you locate it for me?",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0210(0),"Missing? Huh. I'll begin looking at once, Professor.",
TX_MS_THE_000200_0220(0),"Many thanks, my dear.",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0000(0),"Cyrus Albright, by your request, sir.",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0010(0),Do enter.,
TX_MS_THE_000300_0020(0),"My apologies for summoning you on such short 
notice.",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0030(0),"How might I be of assistance, Headmaster?",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0040(0),"That treatise on arcane studies you published... 
What in the gods' names were you thinking?",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0050(0),"Sir? I do believe I made my hypothesis perfectly 
clear...",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0060(0),"I'm not talking about your <span style=""italic"">hypothesis</>!",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0070(0),"You went out of your way to cite one of the 
texts in our special archives.",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0080(0),"The knowledge housed in those tomes is the 
Royal Academy's greatest treasure.",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0090(0),"It is not to be divulged to the public at your 
whim. Laying it bare in one of your silly papers 
is out of the question!",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0100(0),"I am fully aware of the value of those tomes, 
Headmaster. It is for that very reason I would 
share the knowledge with my peers—",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0110(0),"You are to <span style=""italic"">share</> nothing! That wisdom is for 
the academy, and the academy alone!",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0120(0),But that goes against everything—,
TX_MS_THE_000300_0130(0),"Enough, Cyrus!",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0140(0),"(Even my best argument is sure to fall on deaf 
ears.)",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0150(0),"(The headmaster sees knowledge as a medal or 
precious stone. Something to be appreciated by 
its rightful owner alone.)",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0160(0),"(Knowledge is power, and power is to be 
hoarded. An unfortunate attitude, indeed...)",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0170(0),"My sincere apologies, Headmaster. It won't 
happen again. Is there anything else you need of 
me?",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0180(0),That is all. You may go.,
TX_MS_THE_000300_0190(0),...Wait. There was one last thing.,
TX_MS_THE_000300_0200(0),Sir?,
TX_MS_THE_000300_0210(0),"I heard the special archives will be closing early 
today. If you have research to do there, I would 
do so quickly.",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0220(0),"(Good gods. It's as if he enjoys watching me 
suffer.)",
TX_MS_THE_000300_0230(0),"Thank you for your concern, Headmaster. In 
that case, I'll be on my way.",
TX_MS_THE_0003A0_0000(0),...Enter.,
TX_MS_THE_0003A0_0010(0),"Excuse me, Headmaster.",
TX_MS_THE_0003A0_0020(0),"Yes? What is it, Therese?",
TX_MS_THE_0003A0_0030(0),...,
TX_MS_THE_0003A0_0040(0),"It's... It's about Professor Albright, sir...",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0000(0),"Ah, Professor Albright.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0010(0),Did you have any luck finding the tome?,
TX_MS_THE_000400_0020(0),I'm afraid not...,
TX_MS_THE_000400_0030(0),"Well, this is most unfortunate. One might 
conclude that it had been stolen.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0040(0),"Professor, taking books out from these 
archives is strictly forbidden.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0050(0),"And as you know, the keys to the vault are 
entrusted to only a select few!",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0060(0),"Quite honestly, it would be easier to steal the 
crown off the king's head.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0070(0),An impregnable vault...a disappearing tome...,
TX_MS_THE_000400_0080(0),"It would seem we have quite the mystery on 
our hands.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0090(0),"And the mysteries of the world are meant to be 
solved!",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0100(0),"...Or so the scholar in me says. Would you not 
agree?",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0110(0),"If it <span style=""italic"">had</> been stolen, I would say it's a job for 
the city guard...",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0120(0),"But I can see you won't let it go until you've 
""cracked the case,"" as it were.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0130(0),"Ahaha! You could say that, indeed. A habit I just 
can't seem to break.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0140(0),"Once a puzzle is placed before me, I simply 
cannot rest until I've worked out a solution.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0150(0),"Well, far be it from me to stand in your way.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0160(0),It must be tough being a genius.,
TX_MS_THE_000400_0170(0),"Ahaha, I'll not deny it! Worry not—the tome will 
be back on the shelf before you can bat an 
eyelash.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0180(0),"Right, thanks. Best of luck in your search.",
TX_MS_THE_000400_0190(0),(...And the game is afoot!),
TX_MS_THE_0004A0_0000(0),"Now, where to begin my search?",
TX_MS_THE_0004A0_0005(0),"I suppose I should inquire with Mercedes as to 
where the keys to the library are stored.",
TX_MS_THE_0004A0_0010(0),"The guard at the front door would know who 
has been frequenting the library lately. As might 
my fellow scholars...",
TX_MS_THE_0004A0_0020(0),"Then, mayhap, I should pay the headmaster a 
visit as well...",
TX_MS_THE_0004F0_0000(0),"Hmm... I can't help but feel I'm still overlooking 
something.",
TX_MS_THE_0004F0_0010(0),I should investigate further.,
TX_MS_THE_000500_0000(0),"...That should be all the information I need to 
solve the case.",
TX_MS_THE_000500_0010(0),"Who possesses keys to the archives?
- The headmaster and the guard (correct 
answer)
- Russell and the librarian",
TX_MS_THE_000500_0020(0),"Whose key was used to unlock the archives?
- The headmaster's
- The librarian's
- The guard's (correct answer)
- Russell's",
TX_MS_THE_000500_0030(0),"Which means the culprit is...?
- The headmaster
- The librarian
- The guard
- Russell",
TX_MS_THE_0005A0_0000(0),"(No, that simply doesn't add up. Let me 
reconsider this...)",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0000(0),...Of course! It all makes sense now.,
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0010(0),"There are only two keys to the archives—one 
belonging to the headmaster, and one to the 
guardsman.",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0020(0),"The headmaster's key is safely locked away in

archives today.",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0030(0),"On the other hand, the guard has been acting 
suspiciously of late, even sleeping while on 
active duty.",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0040(0),"It would be all too easy a task to lift the key off 
his person.",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0050(0),So is it possible that the guard is our man?,
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0060(0),No...he would have no motive.,
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0070(0),"The culprit must be someone who understands 
the true value of the tome.",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0080(0),"...Which is to say, one of my colleagues.",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0090(0),"And most likely, one who has accrued a frightful 
gambling debt.",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0100(0),"Put it all together, and our villain is...",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0110(0),"Indubitably! That shifty scholar, Russell!",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0120(0),"Yes, I daresay my logic is foolproof.",
TX_MS_THE_0005B0_0130(0),"Now all that remains is to find our man and 
make him confess to the crime.",

underground these days.)",
TX_MS_THE_0005C0_0010(0),"(I think it's time I did some fieldwork of my 
own.)",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0000(0),Professor Albright!?,
TX_MS_THE_000600_0010(0),"Are you always in the habit of barging into your 
peers' offices while they're working!?",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0020(0),"My apologies. I would have knocked, but...I didn't 
see a door.",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0030(0),"Apropos of nothing, mayhap you've heard that 
a certain tome was stolen from the archives.",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0040(0),"...I haven't the faintest clue what you're talking 
about.",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0050(0),"Come now, Russell. Playing dumb is just going to 
drag this out for the both of us.",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0060(0),"So let's cut straight to the heart of the matter: 
you're a thief, and I can prove it.",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0070(0),Wh-what!? The hells you can!,
TX_MS_THE_000600_0080(0),"Unfortunately for you, at precisely the moment 
you were trying to sneak back with the key...",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0090(0),"Your friend the guardsman was just waking 
from his little slumber.",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0100(0),"B-but that's impossible! He was asleep, I'm 
positively—",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0110(0),...Ah!,
TX_MS_THE_000600_0120(0),"Keeping up on our friend's somnolence, are we, 
old chum?",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0130(0),"I-it was a slip of the tongue! I tell you, I know 
nothing about this godsdamned book!",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0140(0),Figured you'd say as much.,
TX_MS_THE_000600_0150(0),"Then perhaps you'd care to accompany me to 
the academy? To prove your innocence, of 
course.",
TX_MS_THE_000600_0160(0),!,
TX_MS_THE_000600_0170(0),D-damn it! Damn it all to hell!,
TX_MS_THE_000600_0180(0),"It was the perfect plan! If not for your bloody 
meddling, I could have had it all!",
TX_MS_THE_000700_0000(0),"I swear, I never meant to...! I just needed the 
money...",
TX_MS_THE_000700_0010(0),"That tome would fetch a small fortune. This is 
true.",
TX_MS_THE_000700_0020(0),"And yet, did you not for a moment consider the 
consequences?",
TX_MS_THE_000700_0030(0),"In stealing that tome, you would steal from our 
students something more valuable than all the 
realm's riches.",
TX_MS_THE_000700_0040(0),"A grave crime no matter who would perpetrate 
it, but all the more unforgivable when 
committed by one who calls himself a scholar.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0000(0),"Well, I'll be! You actually did crack the case of 
the stolen book.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0010(0),"That I did. And yet, I fear this may not be the 
only volume our friend had purloined.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0020(0),"Russell has already confessed to the full extent 
of his crimes...and revealed the names of his 
business associates.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0030(0),"We need only track down the books and 
purchase them back.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0040(0),"I'll speak to the guards and see that we 
redouble security of the archives.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0050(0),"What's this? It says there's another book still 
missing. Did that scoundrel of a scholar steal 
this one as well?",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0060(0),"Ah, <span style=""italic"">From</> <span style=""italic"">the</> <span style=""italic"">Far</> <span style=""italic"">Reaches</> <span style=""italic"">of</> <span style=""italic"">Hell</>. No, I can 
assure you that he did not.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0070(0),It's been missing for some fifteen years now.,
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0080(0),"Russell's aggressive borrowing only extends 
some two years back.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0090(0),"I see. So this volume was lost—or stolen—long 
before that.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0100(0),"...Right as always, Professor.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0110(0),"Pray tell me more about <span style=""italic"">From</> <span style=""italic"">the</> <span style=""italic"">Far</> <span style=""italic"">Reaches</> 
<span style=""italic"">of</> <span style=""italic"">Hell</>.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0120(0),"According to our records, it would seem to be 
a compendium of ancient rites and long-lost 
magicks.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0130(0),"If I am not mistaken, it was the single oldest 
volume housed within our archives.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0140(0),"Needless to say, it was a tremendous loss.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0150(0),"Oho! Yet another mystery, it would seem...",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0160(0),"Professor Albright. The headmaster would 
speak with you at once.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0170(0),Again? What could it be this time?,
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0180(0),"Perhaps he plans to commend you for your 
role in apprehending the library thief.",
TX_MS_THE_0007A0_0190(0),I have no interest in accolades. But if he insists...,
TX_MS_THE_000800_0000(0),"I've brought Professor Albright as asked, sir.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0010(0),...Good. Enter.,
TX_MS_THE_000800_0020(0),"Thank you, Lucia.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0030(0),"Yes, Headmaster? What can I do for you?",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0040(0),Ahem...,
TX_MS_THE_000800_0050(0),"(Something tells me he's not about to offer a 
commendation.)",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0060(0),"...Professor Albright. A most...<span style=""italic"">troubling</> report 
has reached my ears.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0070(0),"A report, sir?",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0080(0),"An anonymous source claims that you have 
abused your prestigious position to enter into 
an illicit relationship with Her Highness the 
Princess.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0090(0),...!,
TX_MS_THE_000800_0100(0),"And you believed this report, sir?",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0110(0),"If it is untrue, then say so.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0120(0),"Why, it is unfounded, unsubstantiated balderdash 
of the highest order.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0130(0),"I would like to take your words at face value, 
Professor, but I fear the situation is not so 
simple.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0140(0),"A rumor regarding the royal family, even an 
<span style=""italic"">unsubstantiated</> one such as this, is sure to 
spread quickly.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0150(0),"If we do not take swift action, Princess Mary's 
good name could be forever sullied.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0160(0),"That is something that simply cannot be allowed 
to happen. Surely, you understand.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0170(0),"And so what do you intend to do with me, sir?",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0180(0),It is not an easy decision to make.,
TX_MS_THE_000800_0190(0),"Dismissing you outright would be tantamount to 
an admission of guilt.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0200(0),"If I may be so bold, Headmaster...what about a 
sabbatical?",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0210(0),"Professor Albright is put on extended leave, 
while official accounts state that he's doing 
fieldwork in a distant land.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0220(0),"What say you, Cyrus? This way both the 
academy's reputation and your own will remain 
intact.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0230(0),"My...<span style=""italic"">reputation</>?",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0240(0),"Do we have a problem, Professor?",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0250(0),"Not at all, Headmaster. On the contrary, this 
might prove the perfect opportunity.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0260(0),Opportunity? For what?,
TX_MS_THE_000800_0270(0),"As a matter of fact, there is a matter which
has piqued my interest of late.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0280(0),"I was just wondering when I might find
the time to do a bit of research in the field.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0290(0),"I think I <span style=""italic"">will</> set forth on a journey...",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0300(0),"(...In search of an ancient tome that disappeared 
fifteen years ago.)",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0310(0),"(Besides, if I am not permitted to share what I

there is little point in continuing my research 
here.)",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0320(0),...Is that so?,
TX_MS_THE_000800_0330(0),"Do tell, Professor. What is it that you intend to 
investigate?",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0340(0),"As regards a certain tome. Now, if you will 
forgive me, I must begin packing for my journey.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0350(0),"Good day to you, Headmaster.",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0360(0),"An enigma as ever, that one...",
TX_MS_THE_000800_0370(0),...,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0000(0),Professor!,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0010(0),"Oh, Therese. What is it?",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0020(0),I...I heard that you were leaving the academy.,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0030(0),Then you heard true.,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0040(0),...!,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0050(0),"P-Professor, I'm...I'm so sorry!",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0060(0),...I see. So you were the source of the rumor.,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0070(0),You...you knew?,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0080(0),"Not until just this moment, when you apologized.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0090(0),"And yet, I cannot fathom your motive. Why 
would you tell such a terrible lie?",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0100(0),"You're always helping Her Highness. Answering 
her every question...",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0110(0),I just wanted you to...pay more attention to me.,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0120(0),And that's why you went to the headmaster?,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0130(0),"Y-yes... But I... I just wanted to get you in
a little trouble...",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0140(0),"I didn't think they would—! I am so sorry, 
Professor. Can you ever forgive me?",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0150(0),"Worry not, my dear. It just so happens that I 
was looking for a good excuse to go on a 
journey.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0160(0),You were?,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0170(0),"For some time now, I've wanted to travel the 
realm, and see what can be learnt beyond these 
halls.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0180(0),I daresay the timing couldn't have been better.,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0190(0),"You see, there's a certain matter I simply can't 
wait to investigate.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0200(0),"So fret not, my girl. If anything, you've done me 
a favor.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0210(0),"Besides, I am not entirely without fault in the 
matter.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0220(0),"Indeed, I have not been as attentive to you as I 
should. Had I realized your true intentions 
sooner, I would not be in this position.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0230(0),Professor... Wh-whatever do you—,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0240(0),"If only I had realized how devoted you were to 
your studies, my dear girl!",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0250(0),My...studies.,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0260(0),"I have always striven to treat all my students 
equally.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0270(0),"And yet, Her Highness is always eager to ask 
questions, and I was all too eager to answer 
them.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0280(0),"In doing so, I may have given the impression 
that I favored her above you and the others. 
This was not my intention, but I am at fault all 
the same.",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0290(0),"Yes, if only I had seen you for the ardent and 
devoted young scholar that you are!",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0300(0),.........,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0310(0),"Um, Professor...?",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0320(0),"Perhaps you're not quite as sharp as I thought 
you were...",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0330(0),Yes?,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0340(0),...Never mind.,
TX_MS_THE_000900_0350(0),"In that case, I should be off. Pray do not shirk 
your studies, my girl!",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0360(0),"Yes, Professor. Will...will I ever see you again?",
TX_MS_THE_000900_0370(0),I do not see why not...provided we both still live.,

TX_NA_THE_010010_0010(0),Even suffering the indignity of losing his post,

TX_NA_THE_010010_0030(0),,

TX_MS_THE_020300_0200(0),The house in which he was born still stands.,
TX_MS_THE_020300_0210(0),"Yet, there are...ominous rumors about the place.",
TX_MS_THE_020300_0220(0),"I have ascertained its location, but I am hesitant

your aid.",
TX_MS_THE_020300_0240(0),"I see... Before I promise anything, I would see 
the house with my own eyes.",
TX_MS_THE_020300_0250(0),"I understand completely. You will find it on the 
north side of town.",
TX_MS_THE_020300_0260(0),Very well. Let us pay it a visit straight away.,
TX_MS_THE_020300_0270(0),"As for whether or not I can cooperate, I will 
give you my answer there. Is this acceptable?",

ahead and meet you there.",
TX_MS_THE_020400_0000(0),"This is where Headmaster Yvon was born and

me, and I will overlook your little trespasses.",
TX_MS_THE_0204A0_0100(0),How kind of you... I refuse.,
TX_MS_THE_0204A0_0110(0),"I am, shall we say, philosophically opposed to 
your stance on knowledge.",
TX_MS_THE_0204A0_0120(0),"I believe that knowledge should be shared, not 
hoarded for one's personal gain.",
TX_MS_THE_0204A0_0130(0),"I thought you'd say as much. Most unfortunate, 
Cyrus...most unfortunate.",
TX_MS_THE_0204A0_0140(0),"As you know, this is my house. And I don't get 
many callers these days...",

pluck for a girl your age...",
TX_MS_THE_0205A0_0090(0),Yvon! Let her go at once!,
TX_MS_THE_0205A0_0100(0),"It is clear hostage negotiation never factored

TX_MS_THE_0205A0_0110(0),"Mark my words, Cyrus. Stop meddling in my 
research, or the girl's life is forfeit.",
TX_MS_THE_0205A0_0120(0),Wait!,
TX_MS_THE_020600_0000(0),Therese!,
TX_MS_THE_020600_0010(0),Pro...fessor...,
TX_MS_THE_020600_0020(0),"You just couldn't leave well enough alone, could 
you?",
TX_MS_THE_020600_0030(0),"You disappoint me, Cyrus. I took you for a 
more logical man.",
TX_MS_THE_020600_0040(0),"Headmaster Yvon. What do you intend to do 
with her?",

were talking about you.",

Thank you, Therese. From the bottom of my 
heart.",

should rest.",

TX_MS_GIL_000700_0120(0),"You say it as if you <span style=""italic"">wanted</> this to happen.",
TX_MS_GIL_000700_0130(0),"Just so. We tightened security for that very

TX_MS_GIL_000700_0140(0),"We figured no thief worth his salt would be able 
to turn down such a challenge.",
TX_MS_GIL_000700_0150(0),...Go on.,
TX_MS_GIL_000700_0160(0),"To this end, we even asked the barkeep for help.",

TX_MS_GIL_000700_0230(0),I should've seen this coming...,
TX_MS_GIL_000700_0240(0),"And yet you did not, and I find myself most 
grateful for your lack of foresight.",
TX_MS_GIL_000700_0250(0),So what's your angle?,
TX_MS_GIL_000700_0260(0),I need not explain that to you.,

TX_MS_GIL_000900_0010(0),What now?,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0020(0),I came to see you off on your journey.,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0030(0),As it is at my behest that you're setting out.,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0040(0),"Look, I'm just fulfilling my half of a bargain. 
Nothing more, nothing less.",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0050(0),"I understand that, but...",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0060(0),"He's right, m'lady. This is simply an agreement 
between us and a skilled, but...<span style=""italic"">shortsighted</> thief.",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0070(0),...Exactly.,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0080(0),"There is something you should know before 
you go.",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0090(0),"As you saw, I recovered a blue stone. It is 
known as the sapphire dragonstone.",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0100(0),"The remaining three are the dragonstones of 
ruby, emerald, and gold—each named for its 
sheen.",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0110(0),"And if I steal them all back for you, you'll 
remove this band.",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0120(0),You have my word.,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0130(0),"Your <span style=""italic"">word</>? Well, that sounds legitimate. Any 
idea where I should start looking?",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0140(0),"Rumor has it that a scholar in Noblecourt is 
researching the ruby dragonstone.",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0150(0),Noblecourt? Great. I'll fit right in.,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0160(0),Mr. Therion!,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0170(0),"What is it <span style=""italic"">this</> time?",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0180(0),Please...do take care out there.,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0190(0),Heh.,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0200(0),...Did I say something amiss?,
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0210(0),"Never thought a man of my talents would be 
working for someone like...",
TX_MS_GIL_000900_0220(0),"Ah, it's nothing. You'll get your stones back 
soon. Just leave the thieving to me.",
TX_NA_GIL_000900_0000(0),And so Therion set forth...,
TX_NA_GIL_000900_0005(0),,
TX_NA_GIL_000900_0010(0),"His mission, which he begrudgingly accepted:",
TX_NA_GIL_000900_0020(0),"to retrieve the remaining three dragonstones of House Ravus,",
TX_NA_GIL_000900_0025(0),that he might have the mark of shame removed from his arm.,
TX_NA_GIL_000900_0030(0),,
TX_NA_GIL_000900_0040(0),Little did he know what fate awaited him...,
TX_NA_GIL_010000_0000(0),– The Story So Far –,
TX_NA_GIL_010000_0010(0),"After successfully infiltrating Ravus Manor,",
TX_NA_GIL_010000_0015(0),"Therion was confronted by the butler, Heathcote,",
TX_NA_GIL_010000_0020(0),who ensnared him with a fool's bangle.,
TX_NA_GIL_010000_0025(0),"Now, he begrudgingly ventures forth",
TX_NA_GIL_010000_0030(0),"to find the three dragonstones, lost treasures of House Ravus,",
TX_NA_GIL_010000_0040(0),"at the behest of their owner, Lady Cordelia,",
TX_NA_GIL_010000_0050(0),that he might have his mark of shame removed.,
TX_NA_GIL_010010_0000(0),,
TX_NA_GIL_010010_0010(0),And so he arrives in this town,
TX_NA_GIL_010010_0020(0),where rumor has it the ruby dragonstone resides.,
TX_NA_GIL_010010_0025(0),,
TX_NA_GIL_010010_0030(0),"As for who holds it, none can say.",
TX_NA_GIL_010010_0040(0),,
TX_NA_GIL_010010_0045(0),And thus Therion's search begins...,
TX_NA_GIL_010010_0050(0),,
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0000(0),"""A scholar in Noblecourt."" Thanks, Heathcote. 
Those are like a leaf a dozen here...",
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0010(0),I need something more to go on than that...,
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0020(0),...I'm glad it's on the outskirts. I avoid it if I can.,
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0030(0),"That creepy old mansion in the northwest part 
of town? I heard someone actually <span style=""italic"">lives</> there.",
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0040(0),Who?,
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0050(0),"A man named Orlick. They said he's some kind 
of scholar.",
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0060(0),What business would a scholar have living there?,
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0070(0),"Research. Apparently he spends all his time 
locked up in his study, studying some shiny red 
stone.",
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0080(0),His men won't let anyone in to see him.,
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0090(0),...,
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0100(0),"If you ask me, it sounds like he's hiding 
something.",
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0110(0),"He may very well be, but I'm fine letting him 
keep his secrets.",
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0120(0),"(The secrets he can keep, but that stone is a 
different story.)",
TX_MS_GIL_010000_0130(0),"(Time to do some research of my own. 
Outskirts of town, was it?)",
TX_MS_GIL_010100_0000(0),(...This must be the place.),
TX_MS_GIL_010100_0010(0),(And of course it's guarded.),
TX_MS_GIL_010100_0020(0),"(A scholar with his own personal armed guard? 
Yeah, that's not suspicious or anything.)",
TX_MS_GIL_010100_0030(0),"(No back door, either.)",
TX_MS_GIL_010100_0040(0),(I can't get a free pass anywhere these days.),
TX_MS_GIL_010100_0050(0),"(I'll swing by the tavern. Someone's bound to 
know something.)",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0000(0),"Now let's see... Who here looks like they'd know 
about our friend Orlick?",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0010(0),"How's business, my friend?",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0020(0),"Not good, I'm afraid. I hope you're faring better.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0030(0),"I wish I could tell you so, but it's been hard 
lately for us too.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0040(0),My condolences...,
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0050(0),"Mine, too. Moving on...",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0060(0),I just don't get those people!,
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0070(0),"Locked away in that manor, surrounded by 
guards...",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0080(0),"It's strange, isn't it?",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0090(0),"Makes me wonder just what Orlick's up to in 
there.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0100(0),That's more like it.,
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0110(0),Mind if I have a seat?,
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0120(0),Not at all.,
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0130(0),Can I get you two a drink?,
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0140(0),"That's mighty kind of you, stranger. What brings 
you here? You don't look like you're from 
around these parts.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0150(0),"I'm a wanderer, going wherever my feet take 
me. And there's nothing better than a tall ale and 
a good tale after a day of traveling.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0160(0),"If you don't mind my asking, who's this Orlick 
fellow you were talking about?",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0170(0),"If you're that interested, we'll tell you all about 
him. Consider it thanks for the drinks.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0180(0),Orlick's the talk of the town right now.,
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0190(0),"He's a scholar, and one I daresay went off the 
deep end. Holed himself up in the building on the 
edge of town.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0200(0),"Word is he's doing some kind of research and 
hasn't come out since.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0210(0),"I heard he's investigating a stone, but nobody 
knows what for.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0220(0),"It definitely sounds like he's got a few screws 
loose.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0230(0),"You got that right! He's one you don't want to 
get involved with.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0240(0),"...Now that I think about it, though, didn't he have 
a research partner?",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0250(0),"Yeah, I heard he was another eccentric one. I 
think he's still doing his research in town.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0260(0),What's his name?,
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0270(0),"...Barnram? Barhand? Barham? Yeah, that's it.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0280(0),"He worked in that manor with Orlick, but they 
went their separate ways after a disagreement.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0290(0),"I guess they were too much for each other to 
handle.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0300(0),"Haha, sounds like it! Anyway, I hope that sates 
your curiosity, wanderer.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0310(0),"It does. Thank you for your time, gentlemen.",
TX_MS_GIL_010200_0320(0),(...Now to track down this Barham.),
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0000(0),Let's see if he's home...,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0010(0),Who's there?,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0020(0),Someone looking for a man named Barham.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0030(0),"I'm Barham. What business do you have with 
me?",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0040(0),"I heard you used to be Orlick's research partner. 
Is that true?",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0050(0),"That was long, long ago. I have nothing to do 
with the man now, and all the better for it.",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0060(0),"If that's all you came here for, you can leave 
now. Goodbye!",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0070(0),Wait. Hear me out.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0080(0),Orlick has something I need.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0090(0),And what's that?,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0100(0),I'll give you a hint.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0110(0),It's the subject of his research.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0120(0),...The ruby dragonstone.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0130(0),That's the one.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0140(0),I surmise you plan to take it from him.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0150(0),(Guilty as charged.),
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0160(0),And you need my help.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0170(0),Mm-hmm.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0180(0),"So you came to ask me how to get into his 
place.",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0190(0),You scholars are quick on the uptake.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0200(0),...,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0210(0),"...Hmph. Very well. I'll give you the answer you 
seek.",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0220(0),You'll need a password to enter.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0230(0),And the password is...?,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0240(0),"Presumptuous, aren't we? I'll tell you on one 
condition.",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0250(0),Let's hear it.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0260(0),"Get what I need for my experiment, and we'll 
call it a deal.",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0270(0),Sounds fair. So what do you need?,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0280(0),"Pure water, filtered through the desert sands...",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0290(0),The kind found only in the most pristine oases.,
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0300(0),"...Silly me. I actually thought your demand was 
going to be reasonable.",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0310(0),"It is, you fool. A merchant from the Sunlands 
oft comes to town selling this very water.",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0320(0),"However, this rarity doesn't come cheap.",
TX_MS_GIL_010300_0330(0),Price is never my problem. Consider it done.,
TX_MS_GIL_0103A0_0000(0),"Come one, come all! I present to you the most 
precious and refreshing beverage in the realm!",
TX_MS_GIL_0103A0_0010(0),"Oasis water, all-natural and free of even the 
slightest impurities!",
TX_MS_GIL_0103A0_0020(0),"One sip and you'll taste the difference! You 
there! How about a drink?",
TX_MS_GIL_0103A0_0030(0),(If you lead a thief to water...),
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0000(0),I hope you're thirsty.,
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0010(0),That was faster than I anticipated.,
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0020(0),"I've fulfilled my half of the bargain. Now tell me 
the password.",
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0030(0),"Now, now. Your half is fulfilled when I <span style=""italic"">say</> it's 
fulfilled.",
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0040(0),...I see what's happening here.,
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0050(0),"I should hope so. I'll need a few more things for 
my experiment, if you'd be so kind.",
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0060(0),"Thieves are notorious for being kind. How can I 
help you?",
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0070(0),"I require a wyvern scale. Can you procure one 
for me?",
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0080(0),I don't know. Where can I find one?,
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0090(0),"They're sold in town from time to time. It's 
highly prized by scholars as a reagent, and 
carries a price to match.",
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0100(0),"...I'm noticing a trend here. But yes, I can get it 
for you.",
TX_MS_GIL_010400_0110(0),Good. I'm counting on you.,
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0000(0),I got what you asked for.,
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0010(0),Perfect. You're quite good at your craft.,
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0020(0),"I need a password, not praise.",
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0030(0),"And <span style=""italic"">I</> need just one more thing.",
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0040(0),Remind me: who's the crook here?,
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0050(0),"That's a fine attitude to have if you don't want 
the password.",
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0060(0),"...Okay, but this is the last one.",
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0070(0),"Yes, I promise. It's a special type of 
ore—metallic in nature, but crystal clear.",
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0080(0),"Once I have it, I can begin my experiment.",
TX_MS_GIL_0104A0_0090(0),Music to my ears.,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0005(0),I got what you asked for.,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0000(0),Catch.,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0010(0),"C-careful with that! Anyhow, thanks. At last I can 
begin my grand experiment!",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0020(0),"Aren't you forgetting something, old man? You 
promised me a password.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0030(0),Cool your heels! The experiment comes first!,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0040(0),"I hope you don't think you can swindle a 
swindler.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0050(0),"Don't be ridiculous. Just be patient, and I'll uphold 
my half of the bargain!",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0060(0),"Orlick and I have known each other since our 
years at the academy. We acquired that manor 
as a place to continue our research.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0070(0),"But he changed after coming across that 
dragonstone.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0080(0),"It was almost like he was possessed, his life 
consumed by his research.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0090(0),"He wouldn't let anyone get near him. Not even 
me...",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0100(0),...,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0110(0),"That's why I want to help you get that stone 
away from him.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0120(0),It's not meant to be held by our hands...,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0130(0),...,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0140(0),"The password is ""the truth of all things.""",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0150(0),"""The truth of all things."" That's easy enough to 
remember.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0160(0),"Yes. And take this with you, too.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0170(0),This is a key.,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0180(0),Observant.,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0190(0),You used those materials to make this.,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0200(0),"You're a natural-born researcher, boy. Now, the 
password will get you into the mansion.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0210(0),"But the door to the laboratory can only be 
opened with <span style=""italic"">that</> key.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0220(0),"Makes you think he doesn't want anyone getting 
in. Not even an old friend like you.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0230(0),"Yes... We may have disagreed from time to time, 
but Orlick is still like a brother to me.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0240(0),"My warnings may have been nothing but noise 
to him, but...",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0250(0),"I wouldn't be much of an older brother if I didn't 
nag from time to time.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0260(0),"Passion is important in our line of work, but 
there's a fine line between that and obsession. 
And Orlick's crossed that line.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0270(0),"So this moving friendship—or maybe, brotherly 
love—is why you're so willing to help me?",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0280(0),"...I wonder. Perhaps it's jealousy or hatred that's 
come to drive me.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0290(0),"But those bygone days are precious to me, 
even now.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0300(0),I know what I feel is true.,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0310(0),...Tugs the ol' heartstrings.,
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0320(0),"But my own reasons are more than enough to 
go through with this. Thanks.",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0330(0),"(Friends, brothers, partners...)",
TX_MS_GIL_010500_0340(0),(...),
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0000(0),...I think we're in the clear.,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0010(0),"Haha, those Cianno bastards finally got what 
they deserved!",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0020(0),"Always strutting around like they bleedin' own 
the place.",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0030(0),"I wish I could see their boats when they realize 
someone beat them to it.",

find <span style=""italic"">our</> treasure.",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0050(0),"Something this rare would be wasted on them 
anyway.",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0060(0),You said it. Now we'll just sell this gem and—,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0070(0),Wait.,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0080(0),Something wrong?,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0090(0),"Where are the gold coins we stole? We said 
we'd split the spoils.",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0100(0),"Hah! Sharp as a tack, aren't ye?",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0110(0),"It's not much, so I thought I'd just hold on to it 
and buy you a tiddly later.",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0120(0),...I see.,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0130(0),Then let's celebrate with this tonight.,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0140(0),"Y-yeah, let's!",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0150(0),...But don't let your guard down.,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0160(0),"The Ciannos will come for revenge at some 
point.",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0170(0),"They call themselves thieves, but they'll resort 
to violence if need be.",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0180(0),"I know. Thanks for lookin' out, partner.",
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0190(0),No problem. Now let's get moving.,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0200(0),...,
TX_MS_GIL_010600_0210(0),...Hmph.,
TX_MS_GIL_010700_0000(0),Halt. What business do you have here?,
TX_MS_GIL_010700_0010(0),"(There's no need to sneak around now that I

TX_MS_GIL_010700_0050(0),Not me.,
TX_MS_GIL_010700_0060(0),"That's odd... Maybe the message just got lost 
somewhere. Anyway, he said it was urgent, so I 
rushed over.",

TX_MS_GIL_030600_0240(0),...Maybe I am a fool.,

TX_MS_GIL_0306A0_0000(0),"Did you forget what I taught you, Therion?",
TX_MS_GIL_0306A0_0010(0),Trust is the first step toward betrayal.,

Therion.",

someone making more. I suppose that's the

TX_MS_GIL_0306B0_0020(0),"I guess the rich and hard-hearted made better

TX_MS_GIL_0306B0_0030(0),"You know I can't hold a candle to your skills as

TX_MS_GIL_030800_0150(0),What do you mean?,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0160(0),The lock has already been undone.,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0170(0),What!?,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0180(0),...He's right.,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0190(0),But when...?,

TX_MS_GIL_030800_0230(0),Mr. Therion...,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0240(0),Did you know it was unlocked the whole time...?,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0250(0),Would it matter at this point?,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0260(0),So tell me what's so special about these stones.,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0270(0),"Darius said they could grant him some great

TX_MS_GIL_030800_0280(0),Well—,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0290(0),"Allow me to answer in your stead, Miss Ravus.",
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0300(0),"The dragonstones are the keys to unlocking the 
Gate of Finis.",
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0310(0),And that is...?,

TX_MS_GIL_030800_0330(0),"It may sound like a mere fairy tale, and yet—",
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0340(0),Darius believed it.,
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0350(0),"...Do you think the dragonstones granted Darius 
the power to rule all of those thieves?",
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0360(0),"I cannot say for sure. But whether or not its 
power or the gate exists...",
TX_MS_GIL_030800_0370(0),"The Ravus family has been the guardians of 
these stones for generations.",

it's got nothin' to do with me.",

TX_MS_GIL_030900_0030(0),She simply came to see you off.,

us?",

you have grown so.",

in here, but we both know he's just an old 
layabout at home. Isn't that right, Father?",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0160(0),"Ahahaha! An old layabout? You wound me, 
Lianna!",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0170(0),"I know your duties at the cathedral keep you 
busy, Father, but—honestly! You're no help at all 
when it comes to keeping a household running!",

am quite useless, after all.",

the realm, where it will serve to light the sacred 
fires that warm and protect all the lands.",

without fail once every twenty years since the 
days of old.",

this journey throughout our history. 
Some...have never returned.",

won't let anyone down.",

years before.",

TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0350(0),Father...?,
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0360(0),"Are you all right, Your Excellency?",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0370(0),"...It's nothing to worry yourselves over. Just 
my years announcing their advance.",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0380(0),"Oh, you mustn't sound so gloomy, Your 
Excellency!",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0390(0),"There is still so much we would learn from you 
before we let you call yourself archbishop 
emeritus!",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0400(0),"Ophilia is right, Father! ...Like she always is.",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0410(0),"You should retire for the day, and let your 
body recuperate. We can handle things from 
here.",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0420(0),"We will let the pontiff know that you are resting 
in your chambers, sir.",
TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0430(0),"When my two girls insist, who is this old man to 
deny them? I will leave the preparations for 
today's service to you.",

TX_MS_ULR_0001A0_0450(0),I'll see Father back to his chambers.,

TX_MS_ULR_000200_0000(0),"I suppose I had best start preparing for the next 
service at once...",
TX_MS_ULR_000200_0010(0),Oh my... What is a child doing here all alone?,
TX_MS_ULR_000200_0020(0),Sniffle... Mamma! I want Mamma!,
TX_MS_ULR_000200_0030(0),"What is the matter, child?",

alone!",
TX_MS_ULR_000200_0060(0),"Now, now. Let's dry those tears. Why don't I 
help you look for your mother?",
TX_MS_ULR_000200_0070(0),Sniffle... Can you really find her?,
TX_MS_ULR_000200_0080(0),"Of course, my child. The Sacred Flame will show 
us the way.",

wander off on your own!?",

brave and good this whole time.",
TX_MS_ULR_0002A0_0060(0),"You are too kind, Sister Ophilia. I know how 
busy you are with your duties at the chapel. 
Thank you for helping me despite that.",

of his two daughters.",

Flamebearer. The realm is blessed to have such 
loyal servants.",

support.",

TX_MS_ULR_0101A0_0010(0),"To you I offer my soul and my blood. With your 
First Flame, I kindle this fire.",

your mercy and your blessing.",

Thank you, Sister Ophilia.",
TX_MS_ULR_0101B0_0010(0),"You must be tired after your long journey. 
Please take this time to rest and recover.",
TX_MS_ULR_0101B0_0020(0),"Thank you for the kind offer, Your Excellency.",
TX_MS_ULR_0101B0_0030(0),"But since I am here, I would love to see more of 
your fair town.",
TX_MS_ULR_0101B0_0040(0),"You honor us, Sister Ophilia. But should you not 
rest first?",
TX_MS_ULR_0101B0_0050(0),"I am stronger than I look, Your Excellency. I shall 
return.",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0000(0),"This is all your fault, Emil!",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0010(0),I...I...,
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0020(0),We're gonna make you sorry!,
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0030(0),I am sorry! I am!,
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0040(0),"You think that if you cry, that'll make everything 
all right?",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0050(0),I'm sorry... I said I was sorry...,
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0060(0),"And what's going on here? Break it up, now, 
break it up.",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0070(0),"Emil lost Derryl's brooch! It's gone now because 
of him!",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0080(0),"I...I'm sorry, Derryl...",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0090(0),"Sorries aren't going to bring back his brooch! 
You know how important it was to him!",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0100(0),Why don't you tell me what happened?,
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0110(0),"Hmph! Ask Emil, if you really want to know! 
Come on, Nate. Let's get out of here.",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0120(0),"You said it, Derryl.",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0130(0),"We'll be back for you later, Emil. If you know 
what's good for you, you better find that 
brooch.",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0140(0),"Emil, was it?",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0150(0),...Yes'm.,
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0160(0),"I'm Sister Ophilia. I am a cleric, journeying on 
behalf of the church.",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0170(0),Journeying...? Oh! Are you here for the Kindling?,
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0180(0),"That's right. But I've already wrapped up with 
the rite, sooo...",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0190(0),"Are you going to help me look for this brooch 
or what?",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0200(0),Y-you'd really do that for me?,
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0210(0),"I really would. So cheer up, got it?",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0220(0),"Thank you, miss—I mean, Sister! Thank you, 
Reverend Sister!",
TX_MS_ULR_010200_0230(0),"Ophilia is fine. Now, let's get down to it.",
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0000(0),Maybe it really is gone...,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0010(0),This is where you last saw it?,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0020(0),"Yeah... Derryl bumped into me, and I guess that's 
when he dropped it.",
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0030(0),Is that so...?,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0040(0),The brooch belonged to Derryl's mum.,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0050(0),She died just the other week...,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0060(0),"That brooch is more important to him than 
anything. I have to find it!",
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0070(0),"That's very kind of you, Emil.",
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0080(0),"Derryl can be rough sometimes, but we're all 
friends.",
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0090(0),"It's just that...well, after his mum died like that... 
He's always so angry about everything...",
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0100(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0110(0),"D'you think he'll play with me again like he used 
to, Sister? If we just find his brooch?",
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0120(0),Of course.,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0130(0),"He'll see how hard you worked to make him 
feel better.",
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0140(0),I'm sure he'll come around.,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0150(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0160(0),(Emil...),
TX_MS_ULR_010300_0170(0),"(I think we've searched enough for the moment. 
Perhaps it's time for a word with Derryl.)",
TX_MS_ULR_0103A0_0000(0),"I'm gonna keep searching, to see if I can't find 
that brooch...",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0000(0),"Derryl, might I speak with you for a moment?",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0010(0),"You're that sister from before... Well, did you 
find my brooch?",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0020(0),"Nope, still missing.",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0030(0),"Then hurry up and find it already! It's more 
important to me than anything!",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0040(0),"We're both looking for it as hard as we can, so 
why don't you forgive Emil, okay?",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0050(0),"It's his fault that it's gone! I'll forgive him when 
it's back!",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0060(0),Not until you get it back? How sad...,
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0070(0),"""How sad""? If anyone's sad here, it's me! I'm the 
one who doesn't have a mum anymore!",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0080(0),"Yes, you are the sad one. I know the pain you 
must be feeling.",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0090(0),"...And I also know that hurting Emil does nothing 
to ease it.",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0100(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0110(0),There is nothing as painful as losing a loved one.,
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0120(0),But do you not love your friends as well?,
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0130(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0140(0),B-beats me! He lost my mother's brooch!,
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0150(0),"He doesn't know how I feel, and neither do you! 
Nobody does!",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0160(0),How could he understand!? He still has a mum!,
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0170(0),"And yet he's still out there searching for your 
precious brooch.",
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0180(0),Searching for his friend...,
TX_MS_ULR_010400_0190(0),"Yeah, right. I bet he's given up and gone home 
by now!",
TX_MS_ULR_0104A0_0000(0),"Derryl, will you come with me? There is 
something I'd like you to see.",
TX_MS_ULR_0104A0_0010(0),Yeah? What is it?,
TX_MS_ULR_0104A0_0020(0),You'll see when we get there.,
TX_MS_ULR_0104A0_0030(0),Hey! Wh-where are you taking me!?,
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0000(0),There. Would you look at that?,
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0010(0),Emil... He's really looking for it?,
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0020(0),"Why...why can't I find it anywhere? Where could 
it have gone?",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0030(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0040(0),"You know, Derryl... Emil told me something.",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0050(0),"He said you've been angry at everything and 
everyone since your mother passed.",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0060(0),"But he hoped—if he could only find your 
brooch—that you might be friends again.",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0070(0),Emil said that?,
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0080(0),"I lost my parents, too, you know.",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0090(0),...Y-you did?,
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0100(0),I was a little younger than you are now.,
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0110(0),"I asked myself over and over, ""Why am <span style=""italic"">I</> the 
only one whose life is so miserable?""",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0120(0),"But my life was not all sadness and misery. I 
was blessed with people who loved me.",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0130(0),"At first, I had closed my heart to them in my 
sorrow. I didn't even try to see how much they 
cared.",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0140(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0150(0),"But there was someone who never stopped 
trying to cheer me up, no matter how much of 
a clodpoll I was.",
TX_MS_ULR_010500_0160(0),(Lianna was always there for me...),
TX_MS_ULR_0105A0_0000(0),"Here, Phili. This is for you!",
TX_MS_ULR_0105A0_0010(0),So now...won't you play with me?,
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0000(0),It was her kindness that saved me.,
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0010(0),"If you close your heart, you'll never realize just 
how much your friends care about you.",
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0020(0),"Do you understand what I mean, Derryl?",
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0030(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0040(0),Hmph!,
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0050(0),It's not my fault! I didn't make Emil do anything!,
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0060(0),"If he wants to search, let him! Why is everyone 
always blaming me!?",
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0070(0),I'm not blaming you for anything.,
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0080(0),Huh? B-but you just said...,
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0090(0),"No one here's blaming you. Unless, maybe, 
you're blaming yourself...?",
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0100(0),"Perhaps you're feeling guilty for making your 
friend feel bad, hm?",
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0110(0),"I can tell you're a good kid, so why don't you be 
honest with Emil?",
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0120(0),B-but I...I'm not...,
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0130(0),"Here, I'll come with you. Let's go.",
TX_MS_ULR_0105B0_0140(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0000(0),...Huh?,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0010(0),What is it?,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0020(0),He's gone.,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0030(0),"Oh, Derryl. What're you doing here?",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0040(0),Oh. I...I just...,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0050(0),"And you're Nate, yes?",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0060(0),Yeah. What's it to you?,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0070(0),We were looking for Emil. Have you seen him?,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0080(0),He was here just a short time ago.,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0090(0),"Oh yeah, I saw him running off after some dog.",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0100(0),A dog?,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0110(0),"Yeah, just a few minutes ago. There was this 
dog, and it had something shiny in its mouth.",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0120(0),"Emil was saying something about how he was 
sure it was the brooch, and he went running 
off that way...",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0130(0),That way? Toward the forest?,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0140(0),The forest?,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0150(0),Is he crazy!?,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0160(0),"That forest is full of monsters! We're not 
allowed to go anywhere near it!",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0170(0),Oh no!,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0180(0),"Ah, it'll be fine. Just think about it.",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0190(0),"Emil's a total coward, right? There's no way he'd 
go into that forest on his own.",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0200(0),"I bet he's running home now, crying all the way!",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0210(0),Sh-shut up!,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0220(0),"Hey, what's your problem? You know what 
Emil's like.",
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0230(0),I gotta go after him!,
TX_MS_ULR_010600_0240(0),Wait! Derryl!,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0000(0),Where'd that dog go?,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0010(0),And how far in here am I...?,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0020(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0030(0),I have to find that brooch!,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0040(0),Emil!,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0050(0),Derryl?,

give me a little more—",
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0070(0),"What're you talking about!? We've gotta get out 
of here!",
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0080(0),But the dog—,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0090(0),Forget about the stupid dog!,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0100(0),But—!,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0110(0),Grrrrrr...,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0120(0),D-did you hear that?,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0130(0),"Run for it, Emil!",
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0140(0),Aaaaaahhhhhh!,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0150(0),Stay back!,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0160(0),D-Derryl!?,
TX_MS_ULR_010700_0170(0),Grrrrrrrrrrrr...,

me—both of you!",

were very brave.",

TX_MS_ULR_010800_0000(0),Y-you saved our lives...,
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0010(0),You kicked its butt...,
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0020(0),"Okay, <span style=""italic"">now</> everything's all right. Good riddance 
to scary monsters.",
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0030(0),Y-you said it!,
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0040(0),"Come on, Emil. Let's go back home.",
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0050(0),"Hang on... If you'll just give me a little bit more 
time...",
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0060(0),"What, more time to get killed!? You think that 
was the only monster in here!?",
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0070(0),But I... Aaah!,
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0080(0),See! I knew I'd find it!,
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0090(0),"Emil, you...",
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0100(0),"Nice going, Emil!",
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0110(0),"Haha, thanks!",
TX_MS_ULR_010800_0120(0),"I knew you had it in you. Now, let's get out of 
here.",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0000(0),.........,
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0010(0),"Emil, I think that Derryl has something he wants 
to say.",

TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0090(0),"I...I think I was just trying to make you hurt, too...",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0100(0),"I...I'm sorry, Emil... I'm so, so sorry!",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0110(0),It's okay.,
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0120(0),"I knew you were sad, and I couldn't do anything 
to make you feel better either...",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0130(0),No one else can hurt you quite like a friend can.,
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0140(0),"But you understand each other now, and that's 
what counts.",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0150(0),"Now play nice, you hear?",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0160(0),"I really am sorry, Emil.",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0170(0),"It's all right. Besides, you saved my life.",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0180(0),"If you hadn't jumped in the way, that beast 
would've eaten me alive.",
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0190(0),Emil...,
TX_MS_ULR_0108A0_0200(0),"All right, boys, save it until we're back in town. 
Come along.",
TX_MS_ULR_010900_0000(0),"I have returned, Your Excellency.",

find our humble town?",

children, who will surely lead it to a bright 
future.",

you had a pleasant encounter in Saintsbridge 
today. Your smile beams as bright as the Flame.",

full of vigor and passion.",

Ophilia... To my eyes, it looks to be a warm and 
gentle flame.",

no doubt your kindness was a comfort to them 
as well.",

hope that I have helped in some small way.",
TX_MS_ULR_0109A0_0000(0),"Hey, Emil. Did you find that brooch?",
TX_MS_ULR_0109A0_0010(0),I sure did! We found it in the woods.,

are all kinds of nasty beasts in there!",

she, Emil?",
TX_MS_ULR_0109A0_0140(0),She really is!,

the truth. She will never again know the

Lianna.",

long you will cling to that belief.",
TX_MS_ULR_0306E0_0000(0),"The desire to revive her dear father meant far 
more to Lianna than your fragile bonds of 
sisterhood. You were never her true family. 
Admit it!",

sorrow and despair.",
TX_MS_ULR_0306E0_0020(0),I was once saved by her kindness...and her love.,

cling to but Galdera...and her Savior!",

meant to—",

TX_MS_BAL_010100_0200(0),"My daughter's already been treated by a 
<span style=""italic"">professional</>, so I'm afraid we won't be needing 
your services. Good day, sir.",

quacksalver...",

another pock-a-therry in town.",

better, and that's what matters, right?",

TX_MS_BAL_0101A0_0070(0),"That must have been the apothecary that 
everyone was buzzing about.",

this rival of mine is, she sure knows her stuff.",
TX_MS_BAL_0101A0_0090(0),What I wouldn't give to be able to pick her brain...,
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0000(0),Hm? What's all the hubbub?,
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0010(0),"Oh, miss, how can we ever repay you?",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0020(0),"Thanks to your tincture, my dear husband is out 
of bed for the first time in weeks!",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0030(0),"My word, it worked like a miracle!",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0040(0),"And for such a modest fee, no less! You could 
charge tenfold and it would still be a steal!",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0050(0),"Oh, you are far too kind. I was only doing my 
job.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0060(0),"Seeing your hale and hearty smiles is payment 
enough for me.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0070(0),"After all, we apothecaries have a sworn duty to 
ease suffering wherever we go, do we not?",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0080(0),"Fine words, those. You must be the apothecary 
everyone's been talking about.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0090(0),"Indeed. Judging from that satchel of yours, I 
trust I am speaking to a colleague?",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0100(0),"You bet—though I've only started my journey. 
I'm Alfyn.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0110(0),Vanessa. Vanessa Hysel. A pleasure.,
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0120(0),"""A sworn duty to ease suffering,"" eh? I like the 
sound of that.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0130(0),"And I couldn't agree more—it's not about the 
coin we make.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0140(0),"So long as I can keep myself fed, the joy of 
knowing I've eased someone's pain is all the 
payment I need.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0150(0),"But of course. It is for that very purpose that I 
seek to ever hone my skills.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0160(0),"Haha! Great minds think alike, eh?",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0170(0),"Hey, would it be too much for me to ask to 
take a look at your pharmaceutics?",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0180(0),Hm?,
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0190(0),"Just hearing about it, it's clear you're out of my 
league.",

could teach me, I'm all ears!",

put food on the table, after all.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0230(0),"No need for apologies. You're quite the diligent 
one, aren't you?",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0240(0),"Oh, you bet! I'm still new to this, after all. Every 
day, I'm learning something new.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0250(0),"At any rate, I'm glad to know this town is in
good hands. See ya around.",
TX_MS_BAL_010200_0260(0),"You flatter me, friend. Fare thee well.",

TX_MS_BAL_0102A0_0000(0),"Alrighty, where should I head now?",
TX_MS_BAL_0102A0_0010(0),Maybe I'll take a stroll by the beach.,

TX_MS_BAL_010300_0050(0),"Heh. I didn't do much, but...payment accepted.",

too.",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0070(0),"You're really raking them in. I bet you could sell 
them at the markets for a small fortune!",

Mother.",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0090(0),Oh?,
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0100(0),"She cries sometimes, because we don't have 
any money.",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0110(0),You don't say...,
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0120(0),"How about you, Alfyn? Do you have money?",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0130(0),"I think you got me beat with all those shells, but 
I get by.",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0140(0),"Are you sure? I can give you some if you need 
them...",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0150(0),"Money makes the world go round, this much is 
true.",

And that's more valuable than all the money in 
the world.",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0180(0),It is?,
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0190(0),You can bet on it.,
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0200(0),Mother says Flynn still needs to rest...,
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0210(0),"But when she's feeling better, we're going to 
come back and collect seashells together.",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0220(0),Don't you worry about that!,
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0230(0),"That Vanessa knows her stuff. Flynn'll be doing 
cartwheels in no time.",
TX_MS_BAL_010300_0240(0),I can't wait!,
TX_MS_BAL_0103A0_0000(0),...What's this?,
TX_MS_BAL_0103A0_0010(0),There seems to be another commotion.,
TX_MS_BAL_010400_0000(0),"Miss Hysel, come quickly! My husband won't 
stop coughing!",
TX_MS_BAL_010400_0010(0),"Oh dear, isn't that a shame? It seems there's a 
nasty malady going around.",

special type of moss, you see.",

treacherous—location.",

leaves a phial should suffice.",
TX_MS_BAL_010400_0110(0),"Oh dear, that is...substantial.",
TX_MS_BAL_010400_0120(0),"Still, my dear daughter's life is at stake! I'll take it!",
TX_MS_BAL_010400_0130(0),"If Lady Hysel made it, I'm sure it's worth every 
leaf. I'll take two!",
TX_MS_BAL_010400_0140(0),"For me as well! I'll spare no cost for the health 
of my loved ones!",
TX_MS_BAL_010400_0150(0),"Pleasure doing business with you, friends.",
TX_MS_BAL_010400_0160(0),"M'lady...I fear my Flynn has come down with the 
cough as well.",

Flynn...",

Can't keep my well-paying patients waiting.",

You're not as stupid as you look.",
TX_MS_BAL_010600_0050(0),"That medicine you gave the townspeople for 
their fevers was brewed from Gaborra 
evergreen, wasn't it?",
TX_MS_BAL_010600_0060(0),.........,
TX_MS_BAL_010600_0070(0),"That was your plan all along. To induce the side

anything you can get for free.",

Why shouldn't everything I want be mine?",

won't let you deceive the weak and vulnerable 
to get it.",

You're a disgrace to our profession.",

suffer?",
TX_MS_BAL_010600_0180(0),"Should it? The ailing, the injured... They're tools 
to an end. Just like the little kittens I test my 
tonics on.",

they've outlived their usefulness...they die.",

TX_MS_BAL_010600_0210(0),"Unfortunately for you, there's no cure for a 
rotten heart.",
TX_MS_BAL_010600_0220(0),So you don't care for my philosophy.,
TX_MS_BAL_010600_0230(0),Perhaps you'd care to die instead? Hmmm?,

you did.",
TX_MS_BAL_010600_0270(0),You're godsdamned right I won't!,
TX_MS_BAL_010600_0280(0),"On the contrary, I'm gonna brew a remedy and

Now, I'll just help myself to some of this moss.",

TX_MS_SHA_000400_0080(0),I-I am most afraid...I cannot...,
TX_MS_SHA_000400_0090(0),I dance at the tavern just down the street.,

monster doin' here!?",
TX_NP_MOS_00050M_D000(0),"I'll stop you right there. Mayhap your tricks 
work on others, but they won't on me!",

TX_PC_ULR_000000_000(0),What are you two doing? Are those cards?,
TX_PC_ULR_000000_010(0),That's right. We were about to play a game.,
TX_PC_ULR_000000_020(0),"You should join us, Ophilia!",
TX_PC_ULR_000000_030(0),"That sounds like fun. But I have no idea how to 
play.",
TX_PC_ULR_000000_040(0),"Not to worry. We can explain the rules to you. 
It'll be a nice little break for all of us.",
TX_PC_ULR_000000_050(0),"Well, if you are offering, how could I refuse?",
TX_PC_ULR_000000_060(0),"(And that's how it started. What we thought 
would be a ""nice little break""...)",
TX_PC_ULR_000000_070(0),(Turned into something that we never expected.),
TX_PC_ULR_000000_080(0),"(...Oh-ho. The eight of swords, and three of 
them no less. A promising hand.)",
TX_PC_ULR_000000_090(0),"('Tis easy to know Tressa's hand, for she 
shows her delight and dismay plainly on her 
face.)",
TX_PC_ULR_000000(101),"(The problem is, what does Ophilia have?)",
TX_PC_ULR_000000(111),Hehe...,
TX_PC_ULR_000000(121),"(Her constant smile makes her impossible to 
read! She must have a tell, but I've yet to find it!)",
TX_PC_ULR_000000(131),"Well, I have two pairs—three of swords and 
five of cups.",
TX_PC_ULR_000000(141),I have three of a kind. The eight of swords.,
TX_PC_ULR_000000(151),"Hehe. I've got four of the same. Six of staves, 
right?",
TX_PC_ULR_000000(161),Unbelievable! Ophilia wins again!,
TX_PC_ULR_000000(171),"A deft player, to be sure! How do you do it, 
Ophilia?",
TX_PC_ULR_000000(181),Hehe. I just let the Flame guide me.,
TX_PC_ULR_000000(191),"I see. You eschew greed, and let nature take its 
course.",
TX_PC_ULR_000000(201),"""Let nature take its course""? What kind of 
strategy is that!?",
TX_PC_ULR_000000(211),"We all have that choice. Fight for what you 
desire, or let the chips fall where they may...",
TX_PC_THE_000000_000(0),Oh no...,
TX_PC_THE_000000_010(0),"What's the matter, Tressa?",
TX_PC_THE_000000_020(0),"Someone told me a ghost story... But I can't 
stand ghosts! They're so scary.",
TX_PC_THE_000000_030(0),"I suppose the notion of spirits can be somewhat 
terrifying.",
TX_PC_THE_000000_040(0),"And you know what else is terrifying? Thunder, 
and debts, and—",
TX_PC_THE_000000_050(0),Debts? That's a strange one.,
TX_PC_THE_000000_060(0),"Strange!? Then what are <span style=""italic"">you</> afraid of?",
TX_PC_THE_000000_070(0),"Now there's a question! I'm most interested in 
knowing what can wilt the Unbending Blade!",
TX_PC_THE_000000_080(0),"Well, I am a poor swimmer. Though that is more 
a weakness than a fear.",
TX_PC_THE_000000_090(0),"Well, that's a surprise, coming from a man of 
action like yourself.",
TX_PC_THE_000000(101),"...I swam a little, as a child. But then forgot the 
skill as I grew into manhood.",
TX_PC_THE_000000(111),"Too much muscle, I warrant. You probably sink 
like a stone.",
TX_PC_THE_000000(121),"Mayhap. ...What of you, Cyrus? Do you have any 
weaknesses?",
TX_PC_THE_000000(131),I have a sneaking suspicion that it may be singing.,
TX_PC_THE_000000(141),A suspicion?,
TX_PC_THE_000000(151),"Well, whenever I give voice to a song, people 
look at me with the queerest expressions...",
TX_PC_THE_000000(161),"Also, they say things like, ""Good thing you're a 
scholar, sir, and not a bard.""",
TX_PC_THE_000000(171),"Well, now I'm curious. Why don't you sing 
something for us?",
TX_PC_THE_000000(181),"Perhaps one song then. I do enjoy a good ballad, 
after all. Ahem...",
TX_PC_THE_000000(191),"...Well, what do you think? ...Tressa? Is something 
the matter?",
TX_PC_THE_000000(201),"...Best leave her be. I believe she is in the midst 
of ruing her curiosity.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_000(0),"So what's with the two rings on your necklace, 
H'aanit?",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_010(0),"They aren keepsakes from my parents. I touche 
them for luck before a hunt.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_020(0),"A foolish superstition, I knowe.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_030(0),"But I remembere holding it tight before my first 
hunt. After that, it becameth habit.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_040(0),"I guess hunters need all the luck they can get. 
So I'm not surprised they'd believe in things like 
charms and rituals.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_050(0),"I don't think it's limited to hunters. I have one as 
well.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_060(0),"You mean, praying to the Flame?",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_070(0),"No, not exactly.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_080(0),"Every morning after reading scripture, I wish 
for a blessed day...",
TX_PC_GIL_000000_090(0),"...before carefully placing a bookmark between 
the pages I had been reading.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000(101),"The bookmark I use is actually a pressed flower 
that I picked from a secret place I know.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000(111),"That is a fine ritual. May it continueth to blessen 
thy days.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000(121),"Oh, I do hope so.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000(131),"What about you, Therion? Do you have rituals 
or superstitions?",
TX_PC_GIL_000000(141),"Of course. Thievery is as prey to Fortune's 
caprice as hunting.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000(151),So what aren thy superstitions?,
TX_PC_GIL_000000(161),"When I break into a house, I always enter with 
my right foot. And I knock on the door first. 
Lightly, of course.",
TX_PC_GIL_000000(171),"I never look portraits in the eye, or steal from 
children's savings boxes. Also...",
TX_PC_GIL_000000(181),Stay! How many hast thou!?,
TX_PC_GIL_000000(191),As many as I need to make off with my prize.,
TX_PC_GIL_000000(201),"I cannot decide if that makes you overly 
superstitious...or eminently practical.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000_000(0),"Why, fresh-baked bread! Mm-mmm... Delicious!",
TX_PC_MAR_000000_010(0),"A crunchy crust, a soft, doughy inside, and at 
the center of it all, a dollop of wild strawberry 
jam!",
TX_PC_MAR_000000_020(0),"Gosh, H'aanit. These <span style=""italic"">are</> rather tasty.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000_030(0),"I am happy that they pleasen thee. It maketh the 
effort worthwhile.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000_040(0),Wait. You made these?,
TX_PC_MAR_000000_050(0),Thou needest not looken so surprised.,
TX_PC_MAR_000000_060(0),I was given a jar of rosehip and strawberry jam.,
TX_PC_MAR_000000_070(0),"Then I asked a local tavern keeper if I mighte 
borrowen his oven. ...'Twas but the work of a 
morning.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000_080(0),"I wish I knew how to bake. In the church, it's 
nothing but porridge and tack most days...",
TX_PC_MAR_000000_090(0),"I coulde teachen thee, if thou wishest.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(101),"Truly!? Why, that would be splendid!",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(111),What do you call this particular confection?,
TX_PC_MAR_000000(121),"Sweetdough. 'Tis a popular treat in mine home 
village.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(131),"...Frankly, I would never have expected you to 
be such a good cook.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(141),"Wherefore thinkest thou so? Hunters spenden 
long days and nights out in the woods...",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(151),"It behoveth us to knowen how to preparen 
meals, lest we starven there.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(161),"Needs must, eh? Well, as my professor always 
said, ""necessity is the greatest teacher.""",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(171),"Necessity, yes. Yet it pleaseth me even more 
that others finden my cooking agreeable.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(181),"Perhaps next time I catche some game, I coulde 
maken a stew, seasoned with forest herbs.",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(191),"With wild turnips on the side, and an apple 
sauce, and...",
TX_PC_MAR_000000(201),(Hehe. I think H'aanit's found a new calling.),
TX_PC_ALI_000000_000(0),"Say, Sir Olberic, about that thing on your arm...",
TX_PC_ALI_000000_010(0),"My brassard, you mean?",
TX_PC_ALI_000000_020(0),"Mm-hmm. It looks like it would fetch quite a 
price!",
TX_PC_ALI_000000_030(0),Is that so?,
TX_PC_ALI_000000_040(0),"Are you going to appraise it? Can you tell how 
old it is? Who made it? Where it came from?",
TX_PC_ALI_000000_050(0),"Not quite. I've just got a hunch, that's all.",
TX_PC_ALI_000000_060(0),Oh.,
TX_PC_ALI_000000_070(0),"Certainly, it is of ancient provenance, passed 
down through generations of knights sworn to 
protect the king.",
TX_PC_ALI_000000_080(0),"Surely it has seen countless battles, and warded 
the blow of countless swords.",
TX_PC_ALI_000000_090(0),"Hehe, I knew it! I could tell with just a glance.",
TX_PC_ALI_000000(101),"Sir Olberic, let me buy it off you. I'll make it 
worth your while!",
TX_PC_ALI_000000(111),"...It is a symbol and token of the comrades who 
served before me. I could not possibly sell it.",
TX_PC_ALI_000000(121),Aww...,
TX_PC_ALI_000000(131),"You mustn't give in so easily, my little merchant 
girl.",
TX_PC_ALI_000000(141),Little!?,
TX_PC_ALI_000000(151),"...Hey, Primrose, have you always had that 
necklace?",
TX_PC_ALI_000000(161),"Why? Is your gut telling you it's a valuable 
treasure, too?",
TX_PC_ALI_000000(171),I don't know about that...but it sure is unusual.,
TX_PC_ALI_000000(181),"What do you say, Primrose? Want to sell it?",
TX_PC_ALI_000000(191),Sorry. It has a lot of sentimental value to me.,
TX_PC_ALI_000000(201),Aww... You guys are no fun!,
TX_PC_RUD_000000_000(0),Ungh...,
TX_PC_RUD_000000_010(0),"Olberic, are you all right? You're moving very 
gingerly...",
TX_PC_RUD_000000_020(0),"My back is terribly sore. The last few days have 
been hard ones.",
TX_PC_RUD_000000_030(0),Want me to take a look?,
TX_PC_RUD_000000_040(0),"If you wouldn't mind, Alfyn.",
TX_PC_RUD_000000_050(0),Hm-hm.,
TX_PC_RUD_000000_060(0),"What's the prognosis, Alfyn?",
TX_PC_RUD_000000_070(0),...It'll clear up. Nothin' to worry about.,
TX_PC_RUD_000000_080(0),"I'll mix up a salve that'll help. But you have to 
avoid overdoin' things.",
TX_PC_RUD_000000_090(0),Very well.,
TX_PC_RUD_000000(101),"You certainly know your stuff, Alfyn. Perhaps 
you can help me, too?",
TX_PC_RUD_000000(111),"You see, my shoulder's been very stiff in recent 
days.",
TX_PC_RUD_000000(121),"Leave it to me, Primrose. Stiff joints are one of 
my specialties!",
TX_PC_RUD_000000(131),"Just bend your arm like so... Right! And then I'll 
knead this knot of muscle here...",
TX_PC_RUD_000000(141),"Oooh, that <span style=""italic"">does</> feel good.
...Ah, much better.",
TX_PC_RUD_000000(151),"Told you I can fix anythin'—you just got to ask, 
is all.",
TX_PC_RUD_000000(161),...,
TX_PC_RUD_000000(171),(Apothecaries are most useful.),
TX_PC_RUD_000000(181),(I like having an apothecary around.),
TX_PC_SHA_000000_000(0),"Ahhhh... Now that's the best drink I've had in a 
long time!",
TX_PC_SHA_000000_010(0),"You said the same last time, too.",
TX_PC_SHA_000000_020(0),"I did? Well, I'm speakin' the truth. Here, have a 
taste of that...",
TX_PC_SHA_000000_030(0),...Hm. Not bad.,
TX_PC_SHA_000000_040(0),You boys look like you're having fun.,
TX_PC_SHA_000000_050(0),"Ah, Primrose! Pull up a seat and join us!",
TX_PC_SHA_000000_060(0),"I'd be delighted. Do you want me to pour you 
more?",
TX_PC_SHA_000000_070(0),"That'd be grand! We've got lots to talk about, 
after all.",
TX_PC_SHA_000000_080(0),...Not bad at all.,
TX_PC_SHA_000000_090(0),Hehe. A nice chat—that sounds perfect.,
TX_PC_SHA_000000(101),...,
TX_PC_SHA_000000(111),...,
TX_PC_SHA_000000(121),Zzz... Zzz...,
TX_PC_SHA_000000(131),Pzzt... Pzzt...,
TX_PC_SHA_000000(141),"Oh, they dozed off. I suppose they were tired.",
TX_PC_SHA_000000(151),...,
TX_PC_SHA_000000(161),"Aw. They look so cute, snoozing away like that.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000_000(0),"I've got a question. Are you any good at writin' 
letters?",
TX_PC_BAL_000000_010(0),Letters?,
TX_PC_BAL_000000_020(0),...Can't say I am. Talking's quicker.,
TX_PC_BAL_000000_030(0),"I oft write letters. When I putte my thoughts to 
paper, they becometh clearer to me.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000_040(0),"So, er, do you deliver them as well?",
TX_PC_BAL_000000_050(0),"Yes. If there is someone I wolde have knowen 
my feelings, I give the letter in person.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000_060(0),"That's mighty wise of you. A letter is important, 
and you don't want some daft fool losin' one.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000_070(0),...Are you speaking from experience?,
TX_PC_BAL_000000_080(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_000000_090(0),"It's like this. I kind of messed up once, a long 
time ago.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(101),Oh?,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(111),I was still just a kid...,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(121),There was a girl in our village called Mercedes.,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(131),"Me and her and my buddy Zeph would play 
together from dawn to dusk, most days.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(141),"When Zeph and I studied late into the night, she'd 
bring us sweets she baked.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(151),"But then one day, we found out she was goin' 
to be sent off to live with distant relatives.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(161),"Way over to the other side of the Middlesea, 
she was goin'. Chances are we'd never see her 
again...",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(171),How sad.,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(181),"Well, Zeph wrote her a letter and he gave it to 
me.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(191),"Said he was too shy to give it to her himself, 
and asked me to deliver it for him.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(201),Turns out he was sweet on Mercedes.,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(211),Haha. The plot doth thicken...,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(221),"Of course, I said I'd deliver his letter. I was his 
best pal, after all.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(231),"So on the day that Mercedes was leavin', I 
headed to her house...",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(241),"But there I found that her coachman had 
suddenly taken sick, and was too ill to drive the 
cart.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(251),...,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(261),"I gave him a salve and some medicine, and after 
a while he was back on his feet.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(271),"You can imagine, I was pretty chuffed with 
myself that I could help...",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(281),"But Mercedes looked so sad, sittin' up there on 
top of the cart.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(291),"""Thank you,"" she said. ""But why didn't Zeph 
come to say goodbye?""",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(301),"That was the last I saw of her. I headed back 
home, ruminatin' about this and that...",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(311),"...but clean forgettin' about Zeph's letter! By the 
time I remembered, it was too late.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(321),"Oh, thou didst not!",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(331),"Somehow, I'm not surprised. So what did you 
do with the letter?",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(341),"I gave it back to Zeph, with my apologies. Along 
with some fish from the river.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(351),"Taught me a good lesson, that little incident did.",
TX_PC_BAL_000000(361),Oh? What was that?,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(371),Deliver your own letters.,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(381),Words to live by.,
TX_PC_BAL_000000(391),Just so.,
TX_PC_ULR_020000_000(0),"There was quite a crowd here before. 
Whatever was the occasion?",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_010(0),"A wedding parade, they were saying.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_020(0),"You don't say! I've assisted at a number of 
weddings myself.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_030(0),"Ah, indeed. Wakes and weddings alike—all fall 
within the purview of the Church of the Flame, 
do they not?",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_040(0),"That's right! Needless to say, weddings are far 
more lively and extravagant.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_050(0),"The highlight is when the bride and groom stand 
before the priest and blow out the twelve 
candles.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_060(0),"That's when the couple makes their vow to the 
twelve gods, right?",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_070(0),"Yes. Although the precise words of the vow 
often differ depending on local custom...",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_080(0),"They usually involve making a promise to face 
any hardships together, and praying for the 
gods to watch over them.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_090(0),"After the vows have been said, the newly wed 
blow out the candles.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000(101),"Come to think of it, I remember seeing a long 
wall of white cloth hung up around the candles.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000(111),"Indeed. The bride's family provides the cloth. But 
do you know the reason for it?",
TX_PC_ULR_020000(121),I figured it was merely to keep out the breeze.,
TX_PC_ULR_020000(131),"In a sense. It is said that ill winds blow out from 
the afterworld when couples make the vows.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000(141),"The white sheets form a barrier between this 
world and the next, keeping death and misery at 
bay.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000(151),"You don't say. Live an' learn, eh?",
TX_PC_ULR_020000(161),"When the time comes for either of you to be 
wed, I would be honored to preside over the 
ceremony.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000(171),"Uh, sure...",
TX_PC_ULR_020000(181),"I shall keep that in mind. Should such a day 
come, that is...",
TX_PC_THE_010000_000(0),"...Cyrus. You really could stand to learn a thing 
or two about the hearts of women.",
TX_PC_THE_010000_010(0),I could...?,
TX_PC_THE_010000_020(0),Yes. But don't worry...I'd be happy to help.,
TX_PC_THE_010000_030(0),"I, um...",
TX_PC_THE_010000_040(0),(I have a feeling I may be in trouble here...),
TX_PC_THE_010000_050(0),"(Come on, just think of it like a storm. You can't 
stop it, so just ride it out.)",
TX_PC_THE_010000_060(0),"Are you two having a conversation through 
glances alone?",
TX_PC_THE_010000_070(0),"Er, not at all! It's nothing. Isn't that right, Therion?",
TX_PC_THE_010000_080(0),...Right.,
TX_PC_THE_010000_090(0),"Is that so? Now listen up, Professor.",
TX_PC_THE_010000(101),You need to choose your words more carefully.,
TX_PC_THE_010000(111),Has my language been somehow improper?,
TX_PC_THE_010000(121),"On the contrary. You're too eloquent for your 
own good.",
TX_PC_THE_010000(131),"Women like charm and eloquence in a man, this 
is true.",
TX_PC_THE_010000(141),"But when you shower a girl with flowery 
words, she's bound to get ideas in her head.",
TX_PC_THE_010000(151),"You have a face that girls are like to fancy. 
You'd do better not to raise false hopes.",
TX_PC_THE_010000(161),"That was not my intention! I mean, I had no idea...!",
TX_PC_THE_010000(171),I think that's her point.,
TX_PC_THE_010000(181),"Of course, if you do have a true interest in a 
woman, you can whisper sweet sentiments to 
your heart's desire.",
TX_PC_THE_010000(191),"Don't assume your feelings are communicated 
as if by magic, like some men seem to believe.",
TX_PC_THE_010000(201),Why are you looking at me?,
TX_PC_THE_010000(211),Because you're precisely who I'm talking about.,
TX_PC_THE_010000(221),"I swear, if I could only mix you two together, I 
might have a real gentleman.",
TX_PC_RUD_020000_000(0),"Tell me, Olberic. How do you keep your skills as 
sharp as you do?",
TX_PC_RUD_020000_010(0),"Well, each day I practice various sword strokes, 
and do exercises to build my strength.",
TX_PC_RUD_020000_020(0),"I always work on the fundamentals, for these 
are the foundations upon which all fighters 
must build.",
TX_PC_RUD_020000_030(0),...A wise choice.,
TX_PC_RUD_020000_040(0),"What about you, Therion? Do you do any 
training?",
TX_PC_RUD_020000_050(0),"Nope. Never was one for practice for practice's 
sake. For me, experience is the best teacher.",
TX_PC_RUD_020000_060(0),"...I see. I have an idea. What say we train 
together?",
TX_PC_RUD_020000_070(0),Didn't you hear what I just said?,
TX_PC_RUD_020000_080(0),"(A man cannot achieve such remarkable agility 
just by sitting in the alehouse.)",
TX_PC_RUD_020000_090(0),"(So he must train—and yet he claims otherwise. 
The question is, why?)",
TX_PC_RUD_020000(101),"Look, I—",
TX_PC_RUD_020000(111),"I think training together is a splendid idea! In fact, 
I think I'll join you.",
TX_PC_RUD_020000(121),"What's the expression? Two's company, and 
three's even better? Something like that...",
TX_PC_RUD_020000(131),...,
TX_PC_RUD_020000(141),"Fine, fine. But just this once, okay?",
TX_PC_RUD_020000(151),It's a deal!,
TX_PC_RUD_020000(161),Then let us go outside and begin.,
TX_PC_GIL_010000_000(0),"Cyrus. What in the hells were you thinking out 
there?",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_010(0),"Are you talking about the recent battle? I was 
only doing my part.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_020(0),"Well, you damn near cast that one spell right on 
my head.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_030(0),"That is because you were standing where it 
needed casting.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_040(0),"...Fine, fine.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_050(0),"Speaking of which... Olberic, I cannot help but 
notice that you seem fond of charging in 
headfirst.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_060(0),'Tis how I do battle. I know no other way.,
TX_PC_GIL_010000_070(0),"Then might I suggest you peruse a book or two 
on tactics.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_080(0),"It is most vexing to have one's allies running 
willy-nilly into the path of one's spells.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_090(0),"(Gah. What are these two arguing about this 
time?)",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(101),"I see. It is my duty is to stand at the van and 
stop the foe.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(111),"If I fail to do this, then you do not have time to 
weave your magic.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(121),"Magic we need, for there are some foes that 
can only be felled by your spells.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(131),"You are quite right. I am only effective for as 
long as you can protect me.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(141),"And when my spells fail, Therion is there to 
sneak in and deliver a coup de grâce.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(151),(Now that's more like it.),
TX_PC_GIL_010000(161),"Just so. Magic and thievery are subtler arts than 
that of the blade.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(171),"Warriors are simple men, and favor the direct 
approach. Your ways are different—but no less 
formidable.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(181),"Well said, my friend! I have nothing but the 
deepest respect for your fighting skills. The 
both of you, that is.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(191),...,
TX_PC_GIL_010000(201),"Is something the matter, Therion?",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(211),"You've been silent for some time now. If you 
have something to say, let us hear it.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(221),"(I have the deepest respect for <span style=""italic"">your</> ability to 
go on and on about nothing.)",
TX_PC_GIL_010000(231),...Maybe next time. I'll talk to you guys later.,
TX_PC_ALI_020000_000(0),"Hehe. Not bad, eh?",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_010(0),"This is Highlands chicken, right? It's been grilled 
to <span style=""italic"">perfection</>!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_020(0),"And this squid is the best to be found in Fisher's 
Bay. Can't you just taste the ocean?",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_030(0),"Shucks, Tress. You might wanna think about 
slowin' down there...",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_040(0),"Indeed. The girl is so slight. Where doth she 
putten it all?",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_050(0),"Speakin' of grub, I suppose you mostly just eat 
what you hunt, right?",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_060(0),Such is the life of a hunter.,
TX_PC_ALI_020000_070(0),...,
TX_PC_ALI_020000_080(0),"When thou needest medicine, thou makest thine 
own. Yes?",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_090(0),"But of course! I'm an apothecary, after all.",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(101),...,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(111),But I can't always find the ingredients I need.,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(121),"Until I hooked up with you, that is. You've 
fetched me darn near everything I've asked for!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(131),I am a proud hunter. It pleaseth me not to failen.,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(141),...,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(151),I've got it!,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(161),"Whoa! You gave me a start there, suddenly 
shoutin' out like that.",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(171),"Thou hast ""got it""? What hast thou ""got,"" praye 
tell?",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(181),"The three of us should go into business 
together!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(191),Huh?,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(201),What dost thou meanen?,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(211),"You can hunt for ingredients, Alfyn will mix 
them into medicine...",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(221),"And then I can take charge of selling the 
product. We'd make a perfect team!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(231),Hmm...,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(241),"A venture that wolde maken the most of our 
individual talents. Thou makest an intriguing 
proposal.",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(251),"I know, right? We could really rake it in—so let's 
do it!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(261),"What better time than the present, eh? I declare 
us open for business!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(271),"Er, can I think about this a bit?",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(281),And I as well...,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(291),"What's there to think about? C'mon, you've got 
to grab the bull by its horns!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(301),"Thing is, I'm not wantin' for money...",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(311),"I, too, possesse all that I need.",
TX_PC_ALI_020000(321),...,
TX_PC_ALI_020000(331),"I never thought <span style=""italic"">making</> money could be such a 
deal breaker...",
TX_PC_SHA_010000_000(0),"Ah, how relaxing. A fine tavern, wouldn't you 
say?",
TX_PC_SHA_010000_010(0),"Indeed. The spirits are excellent, and all the 
better in the company of such lovely women.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000_020(0),Excuse me?,
TX_PC_SHA_010000_030(0),"That's not very professional, Professor.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000_040(0),"It isn't? Oh, forgive me.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000_050(0),"Tellen me, Primrose. Thou hast danced in 
taverns afore, yes?",
TX_PC_SHA_010000_060(0),That's right.,
TX_PC_SHA_010000_070(0),"I coulde not imaginen dancing in front of anyone, 
let alone drunken strangers.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000_080(0),"Truth be told, I envye thy talent, and the joy that 
thou dost surely feelen.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000_090(0),"I daresay Primrose brings a lot of joy to her 
audience as well.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(101),"By the time she's taken a few steps, she has the 
entire room under her spell.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(111),"Heh... You have a way with words, Professor. 
Perhaps we could all dance together next time.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(121),Erm...,
TX_PC_SHA_010000(131),"Oho. To be taught by Primrose, star of the 
stage, would be an honor indeed!",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(141),I feare it maye not comen to me easily...,
TX_PC_SHA_010000(151),"Oh, it's simple enough. You just need to listen to 
the music and move in time with it.",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(161),"You don't have to be perfect or anything. Just 
enjoy yourself!",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(171),Dost thou truly believen so?,
TX_PC_SHA_010000(181),"Well, I, for one, am game. Nothing ventured, as 
they say!",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(191),"Heh, splendid! May I have this dance?",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(201),"...Erm, ah...sorry. L-like this?",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(211),...,

TX_PC_SHA_010000(271),"Hm? Or, er... Well...",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(281),"I know! Let's have another drink! This is a 
tavern, after all—not a dance hall!",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(291),"I told thee, did I not...!?",
TX_PC_SHA_010000(301),"Yes, quite. Maybe there's something to be said 
for sticking with what you know, eh?",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_000(0),Oh no...,
TX_PC_BAL_020000_010(0),"What's the matter, Tressa?",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_020(0),"Look at my skin, Ophilia! I've got this nasty boil...",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_030(0),"I guess I haven't been taking very good care of 
myself lately, but it sure isn't easy with all this 
traveling and fighting!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_040(0),"I know what you mean. My hair is all frazzled 
and frayed...",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_050(0),"But I suppose it's no use. Good nights of sleep 
and warm baths are a luxury on the road, after 
all.",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_060(0),Not that the men seem to care much.,

TX_PC_BAL_020000(101),"Hey, who are you callin' old!?",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(111),"Hehe. I'm just teasing, Alfyn! Anyway, what 
brings you here?",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(121),It seems he's brought us something.,
TX_PC_BAL_020000(131),You bet I have! Feast your eyes on this...,
TX_PC_BAL_020000(141),"This here is Lovely Lace: an herb known for 
smoothing and softenin' the skin.",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(151),...!,
TX_PC_BAL_020000(161),...!,
TX_PC_BAL_020000(171),"Rub it on any blotches, wrinkles, or boils and 
watch them fade away!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(181),"And that's not all! Mix it with water and run it 
through your hair to make your locks flow like 
silk.",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(191),"Why, it sounds like a miracle!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(201),"Wow, you really do have all sorts of treasures 
in that bag of yours!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(211),Haha! It's just what I do.,
TX_PC_BAL_020000(221),"So if I want some of this... How much would 
that cost me?",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(231),"I wouldn't think of sellin' it to my friends. It's 
yours for free!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(241),"Aww, you're too kind!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000(251),"It's like he was sent down to us by Aelfric 
himself...",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_000(0),"Hey, H'aanit. You've got a cute pet there.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_010(0),Pet...?,
TX_PC_MAR_010000_020(0),"I must agree. Your snow leopard is absolutely 
beautiful.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_030(0),"Ah, thou speakest of Linde.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_040(0),"A beautiful beast she is, but she is no pet. She 
is...my comrade.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_050(0),"Even better, no?",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_060(0),"Indeed. She was gifted to me by a fortune-teller 
when I was but an infant.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_070(0),"She hath always been at my side, and we haven 
grown up together.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_080(0),"We knowen everything about each other. We 
haven no secrets.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000_090(0),You don't say?,
TX_PC_MAR_010000(101),"Dost thou enjoyen the company of beasts, 
Tressa?",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(111),"Oh, sure. I have a pet squirrel back home.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(121),"Squirrels are shy creatures, aren't they? Can 
they be tamed?",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(131),"They sure can! Ours even helps out when we're 
buying supplies.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(141),"She's got a nose for the ripest nuts and fruit, 
which we can turn around and sell for a big 
profit.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(151),A little merchant squirrel! How adorable.,
TX_PC_MAR_010000(161),"Charming, indeed.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(171),"What about you, Primrose? Do you have pets?",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(181),"No, I don't.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(191),Although people often tell me I'm a lot like a cat.,
TX_PC_MAR_010000(201),"Hah, I can see that!",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(211),"You know how cats act like they want to be left 
alone, but then end up following you and sitting 
on your lap?",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(221),"...Aye. I, too, can see a resemblance.",
TX_PC_MAR_010000(231),Is that supposed to be a compliment?,
TX_PC_ALL_090000_000(0),"That should do 'er! Now the ale's ready for 
drinking!",
TX_PC_ALL_090000_010(0),"And we're all here, right on time.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000_020(0),"...But I want everyone to know that drinks can 
be enjoyed all the same in complete silence.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000_030(0),"Come, now. Where is the fun in that?",
TX_PC_ALL_090000_040(0),"I now pronounce the Official Drinking Games 
underway! Gentlemen, you may begin!",
TX_PC_ALL_090000_050(0),...I...I concede.,
TX_PC_ALL_090000_060(0),"Giving up early, ain't you, Professor?",
TX_PC_ALL_090000_070(0),"Indeed. You must forgive me, but I'd rather 
drink at my own pace, or not at all.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000_080(0),"(Out, but not down, huh?)",
TX_PC_ALL_090000_090(0),"(He's a man who likes to savor his drinks, it 
would appear.)",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(101),"I've got to hand it to you fellahs. Guys back in 
the village would already be under the table.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(111),"Thieves who can't hold their liquor aren't long 
for the business.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(121),"I, too, oft had need to drink in my younger days. 
Familiarity breeds resilience.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(131),"...Indeed. But there are limits. Practice and 
familiarity can only take you so far.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(141),"Well, I ain't done yet—another round!",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(151),"...All right, I'm calling it quits.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(161),"Hahaha. You lily-livered milksop! I'm good for 
another cask!",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(171),"I know when to cut my losses. But I've got to 
hand it to you: you're stronger than you look.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(181),That's what they all say!,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(191),"('Tis a wise bandit indeed, who puts down his 
glass before his agility is adversely affected.)",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(201),"It's just you an' me then, Olberic!",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(211),"Haha! Let the duel commence, my medicinal 
friend!",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(221),Uh-oh...,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(231),Hohoho...,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(241),"(By the gods, he's like a bottomless barrel!)",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(251),"(He's been smilin' and relaxed like he's only on 
his third mug—what's it gonna take to knock 
him out!?)",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(261),Hohoho...,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(271),"(Demons take me, but I cannot seem to stop 
giggling...)",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(281),"(I haven't been pushed this far in a drinking 
game since my contest with Erhardt—a match 
that I lost.)",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(291),"(I reckon the next glass will be his last, though...)",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(301),(Have I met my match once more...?),
TX_PC_ALL_090000(311),"All right, that's enough, you two.",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(321),"Wh-what d'ya mean? I'm just getting' warmed 
up...",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(331),Tell that to the tavern master.,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(341),I declare a tie—you are both victors.,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(351),"Ah, shucks. Well, if they ain't servin' no more, I 
guess we got no choice...",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(361),Exactly.,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(371),Hahaha...ha...ha...,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(381),It appears Sir Olberic continues to be amused.,
TX_PC_ALL_090000(391),"Nevertheless, what do you gentlemen say to 
finding another tavern that's still serving?",
TX_PC_ALL_090000(401),"(In the end, none of us can hold a candle to this 
guy...)",
TX_PC_ALL_090010_000(0),"Where did Linde get to, H'aanit?",
TX_PC_ALL_090010_010(0),"She hath gone outside. Running about and 
chasing hares, I warrant.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010_020(0),Of course.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010_030(0),"She's so docile and obedient, I sometimes forget 
that she's still a wild creature.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010_040(0),Just so.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010_050(0),"Cyrus. I will that you not sneaken up on me like 
that. I mighte loosen an arrow into your side.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010_060(0),"Can we help you with something, Professor?",
TX_PC_ALL_090010_070(0),"I find myself most fascinated by your ability to 
control beasts, H'aanit.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010_080(0),"If it were no trouble, I would like to ask you 
some questions, at some opportune time.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010_090(0),Of course.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(101),"Truth be told, I am curious about all of thee, too.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(111),"Primrose and her dancing, Cyrus and his studies...",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(121),Therion's thievery...,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(131),That so?,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(141),"Especially thee. I wondere how thy fingers 
became so dexterous.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(151),Practice makes perfect.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(161),"Speaking of which, I have observed you 
sometimes writing and whittling with your 
opposite hand...",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(171),"Is that ""practice,"" too?",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(181),Mm-hmm.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(191),"So you train both hands to improve your 
dexterity...",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(201),"Why so perplexed? It's not much different than 
you practicing your aim.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(211),Or Primrose practicing her dancing.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(221),"Just so. Primrose, thou dost leaven our 
company and hiden thyself away at times...",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(231),I hate spectators during practice.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(241),"I need to get a dance perfect before I can do it 
in front of anyone.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(251),You are dedicated to your art.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(261),"So what about you, Professor? Do you practice 
studying?",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(271),"In my case, I develop my powers of deduction 
and insight by reading tomes and closely 
observing people.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(281),"I attempt to guess what other people are 
thinking. It sharpens my mind, and, I confess, 
amuses me, too.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(291),"That remindeth me. Earlier, Linde growled at 
thee in warning.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(301),"Was that a warning? ...I suppose I should 
apologize for what transpired earlier, then.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(311),Oh? And what's that?,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(321),"You see, I was curious about snow leopard 
biology, and so undertook a careful study of 
Linde.",
TX_PC_ALL_090010(331),From morning to night?,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(341),Precisely.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(351),It's no wonder the poor dear's wary of you.,
TX_PC_ALL_090010(361),"I hope this has been a lesson to you, <span style=""italic"">Professor</>.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020_000(0),Hmm...,
TX_PC_ALL_090020_010(0),"Hey, Tressa. Is something the matter? Looks like 
you've got a lot on your mind.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020_020(0),"Well, there was a man sitting over there, right?",
TX_PC_ALL_090020_030(0),Right.,
TX_PC_ALL_090020_040(0),"He seemed awfully cold, with that cloak 
wrapped so tightly around him.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020_050(0),"Exactly! He was clinging onto that cloak for dear 
life.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020_060(0),So I was just thinking...,
TX_PC_ALL_090020_070(0),"If you needed to get him to take off the cloak, 
how would you do it?",
TX_PC_ALL_090020_080(0),"Hoho. A riddle, is it?",
TX_PC_ALL_090020_090(0),Hmm... I would challenge him to a duel.,
TX_PC_ALL_090020(101),"Should he accept, he would naturally remove 
the cloak of his own choosing.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(111),"I suppose that's fine if you've got a big sword 
and don't mind getting into a fight...",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(121),Haha! She's right there!,
TX_PC_ALL_090020(131),"You can't go pushin' your weight around and 
bullyin' people to fight you all the time.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(141),"Then what would <span style=""italic"">you</> do?",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(151),Simple. I'd make friends with the fellah.,
TX_PC_ALL_090020(161),"Share a mug of mead, tell a few jokes, then ask 
him to take off the cloak.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(171),"How very like you, Alfyn!",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(181),"It's easy to get people to trust you when it's 
your job to cure them.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(191),"And you, Ophilia? How would you do it?",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(201),"Me? Oh, well. Erm, I don't know...",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(211),"Perhaps I'd take him somewhere nice and warm. 
After all, I wouldn't <span style=""italic"">want</> him to take it off, if he 
was cold without it.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(221),"Hahaha! Now, ain't that just like Ophilia?",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(231),"I guess he'd be more willing to listen to a 
request from someone so considerate...",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(241),"You know, I'm learning a lot here.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(251),"I suppose you'd offer to buy the cloak, right, 
Tressa?",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(261),"You got that right! Except, that cloak happens to 
be a collector's piece.",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(271),I'm pretty sure he wouldn't part with it willingly.,
TX_PC_ALL_090020(281),"But thanks to you, I know just what to do!",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(291),"I'll challenge him to a fight, befriend him, then 
take him somewhere nice and warm! If that 
doesn't do the trick, I don't know what will!",
TX_PC_ALL_090020(301),(...),
TX_PC_ALL_090020(311),(...),
TX_PC_ALL_090020(321),(...),
TX_PC_ALL_090030_000(0),"I think it's fascinating how we managed to find 
each other in this great, big world.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030_010(0),Don't you?,
TX_PC_ALL_090030_020(0),Aye. 'Tis as if fate hath drawn us together.,
TX_PC_ALL_090030_030(0),I look forward to hearing everyone's stories.,
TX_PC_ALL_090030_040(0),"As do I. Everyone, no matter how grand or 
humble, has their own story to tell.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030_050(0),"I want to know more about your hometowns. 
Were there any tasty foods there?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030_060(0),"Well, I always tell visitors to try our winter 
vegetable soup.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030_070(0),"Ooh, that sounds delicious. I love vegetables!",
TX_PC_ALL_090030_080(0),"It's probably good for your skin, too.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030_090(0),And just one sip will warm you right up.,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(101),"How about you, H'aanit? What's the food back 
home like?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(111),"It is good. But in my village, there is an inn that 
serveth wild boar roasted over an open fire.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(121),"Truth be told, it is the finest food I have ever 
tasted.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(131),Roasted boar? Gosh...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(141),"That does sound good. But perhaps not the 
most romantic choice.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(151),Hm?,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(161),R-romantic!?,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(171),You mean like...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(181),"Sharing a delicious meal with a special 
someone? Right...?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(191),"Master and I oft ate together. Doth that counten 
as romantic?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(201),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(211),"Don't tell me you've never been romanced 
before.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(221),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(231),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(241),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(251),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(261),I see I have a lot of explaining to do.,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(271),It's like this...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(281),Ooooooh...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(291),Ooooooh...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(301),Ooooooh...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(311),Ooooooh...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(321),"Primrose, you have to tell us more!",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(331),"Yes, please! Impart us with your wisdom!",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(341),"I, too, have some interest in what you knowest.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(351),"All right, then. We'll start by you telling me what 
kind of men you like.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(361),...!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(371),...!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(381),...!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(391),...!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(401),"H'aanit, you first. What's your type?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(411),"Me? Well, er, I have not thought upon it, truth be 
told...",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(421),Perhaps...someone who is stronger than me...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(431),Eh? But...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(441),"If such men exist, they must be ever so rare!",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(451),Thinkest thou so?,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(461),"Oh, I wouldn't say <span style=""italic"">rare</>, exactly. But...not 
common, either.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(471),"Every man has his weakness. It's just a matter 
of finding it.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(481),Oooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(491),Oooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(501),Oooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(511),Oooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(521),"I could listen to you talk about this all day, 
Primrose. You know everything!",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(531),Hehe. Thank you.,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(541),"So, Ophilia? What kind of man do you like?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(551),"I was raised in the church, so I haven't had 
much opportunity to compare...",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(561),But I suppose I'd want someone who's nice.,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(571),"Aw, how sweet.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(581),"Oh, come on. Try to be more specfic! Narrow it 
down a little.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(591),"Indeed. What dost thou desiren, in thine heart?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(601),"Desire!? Well, there's no room in my heart for 
such a thing...",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(611),There most certainly is! So tell us. We're waiting!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(621),"I suppose it's rude to keep you waiting... Well, I'll 
try to keep it short then.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(631),"I want a man who's compassionate, caring, 
thoughtful, and upright.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(641),"He has to be able to handle a sword, but also be 
clever. Like a scholar.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(651),"Someone who's hard on himself, but forgiving 
of others.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(661),"Oh, and taller than me, of course. And broad-
minded and tolerant. And generally wonderful.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(671),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(681),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(691),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(701),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(711),"Well, you definitely narrowed it down.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(721),"Indeed. So narrow as to excludeth all men that 
ever lived...",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(731),"You see? I <span style=""italic"">knew</> I shouldn't have told you... This 
is so embarrassing.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(741),"Ophilia, let me give you one piece of advice.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(751),"""Don't pin your dreams on a man.""",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(761),Ooooooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(771),Ooooooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(781),Ooooooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(791),Ooooooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(801),"How do you know so much, Primrose? It's 
amazing!",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(811),"It all comes down to experience, ladies.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(821),"Gosh, I'm learning so much!",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(831),"By the by, Tressa. You haven't told us what kind 
of man <span style=""italic"">you</> like.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(841),"What? Oh, haha! You don't <span style=""italic"">really</> want to hear 
about my type...do you?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(851),Tressa...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(861),We're waiting!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(871),"W-well then, if you insist...",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(881),"I like a man who doesn't try to return 
merchandise after he's already paid for it.",

TX_PC_ALL_090030(911),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(921),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(931),"That's so like you, Tressa.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(941),"Primrose, hast thou advice?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(951),"Tressa... You need to forget about trading for a 
bit.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(961),"You can't buy a good man, you know. It takes 
love and affection.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(971),Oooooooooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(981),Oooooooooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(991),Oooooooooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1001),Oooooooooh!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1011),I'll take that lesson to heart!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1021),"As will I. We've learned so much from your 
experiences, Primrose!",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1031),"Now what about thee? What sort of man dost 
thou favoren?",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1041),"Me? Well, that's easy.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1051),"See, what I like in a man is...",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1061),...!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1071),...!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1081),...!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1091),...!,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1101),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1111),"Oh, would you look at that? We're out of drinks. 
I suppose we should call it a day.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1121),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1131),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1141),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1151),...,
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1161),"It's been fun, ladies. Let's chat again soon.",
TX_PC_ALL_090030(1171),"B-but we're not done here yet! Primrose...? 
Come back, Primrose!",
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0000(0),So that is the famous Victors Hollow arena!,
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0010(0),You have heard of it.,
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0020(0),"Oh, yes. The histories say that it was first built 
as a penal circus, where prisoners were made 
to fight to the death.",
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0030(0),A cruel practice.,
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0040(0),"Quite. But people eventually wearied of watching 
men die for sport...",
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0050(0),"And the fights became more humane, less 
deadly.",
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0060(0),"Forced duels between prisoners were banned. 
Only free men and volunteers could fight.",
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0070(0),"Now the arena is where men come to test their 
mettle and win glory for themselves.",
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0080(0),"Tell me, Olberic. What do you think of this 
present-day arena?",
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0090(0),"It is honorable. Far better than forcing poor 
wretches to kill or be killed.",
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0100(0),It is still a blood sport.,
TX_PC_RUD_010000_0110(0),"...But fought between free men who can choose 
not to, if that is their will.",
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0000(0),What do you think of this Cecily woman?,
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0010(0),She appears to have a keen eye for fighters.,
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0020(0),Why do you ask?,
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0030(0),"It's just that I've seen many a man fall victim to 
hardheaded women like her.",
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0040(0),"They're seduced with promises, cajoled into 
submission, and eventually led into financial ruin.",
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0050(0),I am no woman's fool.,
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0060(0),"Just watch yourself, Olberic. Don't be taken in 
by glib words, or you may regret it later.",
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0070(0),I appreciate the warning.,
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0080(0),"Still, from what I can tell about Cecily...",
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0090(0),"I honestly think she just loves the arena and the 
tournaments...",
TX_PC_RUD_010100_0100(0),I see...,
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0000(0),Just listen to those birds sing!,
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0010(0),"Maybe they're celebrating your victory, Sir 
Olberic.",
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0020(0),Haha. Mayhap they are.,
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0030(0),"By the way, that Victorino reminds me of the 
folk back home.",
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0040(0),"He's a real man of the sea: straight-talking and 
honest, with no time for hogwash.",
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0050(0),"You know, I've got a feeling he and I would get 
along. Just thinking about it makes me miss my 
little port town!",
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0060(0),Is that so?,
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0070(0),"Yup! My father said that the ocean is so 
beautiful, it washes people's hearts clean.",
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0080(0),"When you look out at the horizon and realize 
how huge it is...you can see your troubles for 
what they are.",
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0090(0),Then the ocean is a fine thing indeed.,
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0100(0),"You're the same, Sir Olberic. You're like a big 
tree.",
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0110(0),"Steadfast and calm. Nothing sways you. You 
have a great view—Oh!",
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0120(0),Hm?,
TX_PC_RUD_0103B0_0130(0),(A little bird landed right on his shoulder!),
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0000(0),...Tsk.,
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0010(0),Is something troubling you?,
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0020(0),"...Aye. I am dwelling upon a happening from the 
past.",
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0030(0),An unhappy memory?,
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0040(0),"Thou couldst say that. Master once wagered a 
great sum at the arena and lost it all.",
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0050(0),"He had received payment for a hunt, but was 
left destitute and unable to returnen home.",
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0060(0),That was not very masterly of him.,
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0070(0),Indeed!,
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0080(0),"To payen off his debts, we weren forced to 
sharen our earnings for many months after, 
and oft went hungry.",
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0090(0),"Visiting this arena hath brought back the 
memory of that bitter time.",
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0100(0),I am sorry to hear it.,
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0110(0),"Forgiven me. I did not will to burden thee with 
my woes.",
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0120(0),"Nor shalle I leten them hindereth our mission 
here.",
TX_PC_RUD_010405_0130(0),Hmm...,
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0000(0),Why do I fight...?,
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0010(0),"What's the matter, Olberic? You look deep in 
thought.",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0020(0),Indeed I am.,
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0030(0),"I realized that every man who takes up arms 
has a reason to do so.",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0040(0),"I have tried not to dwell on the many men who 
have fallen to my blade.",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0050(0),"But now I find myself asking... Why do I fight? 
Why do I wield this sword?",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0060(0),"I can't pretend to know much about swords and 
soldiers.",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0070(0),"But I have noticed one thing. You're different 
from other fighting men I have known.",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0080(0),There's a kindness in you...,
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0090(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0100(0),"I sense tenderness, and mercy to those whom 
you're forced to vanquish.",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0110(0),"Whatever your reason turns out to be, I'm glad 
you fight alongside us.",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0120(0),...I had never thought of myself in that way.,
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0130(0),"Thanks be to you, Ophilia. Your words give me 
strength.",
TX_PC_RUD_0105E0_0140(0),"Oh, it's my pleasure.",
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0000(0),"By the gods, Olberic, you're invincible—or near 
enough to be the same!",
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0010(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0020(0),"Nay. I am just a man who carries a sword, and 
has learned how to use it.",
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0030(0),"Today I was better than my opponent. No more, 
no less.",
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0040(0),"If you say so.
...Hey-ho?",
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0050(0),What is it?,
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0060(0),"You've picked up an injury there, my friend.",
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0080(0),You can't hide it from me.,
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0090(0),"If you don't treat cuts they can get the rot, and 
then you'll be in trouble.",
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0100(0),"So stop pretending it's nothin' and let me fix it 
for you. It's my job, after all.",
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0110(0),Thank you. I shall repay you.,
TX_PC_RUD_010700_0120(0),"Aw, shucks. You don't need to do that!",
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0000(0),"An old friend, eh?",
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0010(0),"Erhardt? Aye, I called him friend, once upon a 
time.",
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0020(0),But it ended the day he struck down our king.,
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0030(0),And you still want to see him again?,
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0040(0),I would speak to him.,
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0050(0),There is something I need to know.,
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0060(0),"And you think meeting him will give you 
closure? What happens if you don't like the 
answer you get?",
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0070(0),"...Are you sure you're not doing this for your 
own self-satisfaction?",
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0080(0),Perhaps you are right.,
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0090(0),"But I must see him, if I am to put the past 
behind me.",
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0100(0),"I won't try and stop you. In fact, I think I'll stick 
around and see how this one unfolds.",
TX_PC_RUD_0108A0_0110(0),Be my guest.,
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0000(0),"An oasis—the font of life in the arid waste of 
the desert.",
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0010(0),"Just so. This one oasis provides water for all 
the towns hereabout.",
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0020(0),Is that so?,
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0030(0),"Yes. Some villages have small wells, but nothing 
to match the amount of water that flows forth 
here.",
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0040(0),"Civilization has flourished in this place since 
ancient times.",
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0050(0),"It really is something of a miracle, this oasis. A 
blessing from the gods.",
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0060(0),"Then I must do what I can to save this 
civilization.",
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0070(0),Are you with me?,
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0080(0),Of course. You will have my utmost support.,
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0090(0),"Why, with your brawn and my brains, I'm fain to 
say we shall be unstoppable!",
TX_PC_RUD_020300_0100(0),...I pray it be so.,
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0000(0),Lizardmen. I like them not...,
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0010(0),You know these creatures?,
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0020(0),Aye. At least their water-dwelling cousins.,
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0030(0),"These aren adapted for the sands, but they still 
needen water to liven.",
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0040(0),"Then this oasis is as essential to their survival 
as it is to the people here.",
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0050(0),Indeed.,
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0060(0),"They aren wary, mistrustful creatures, and 
attacketh all whom wanderen into their domain.",
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0070(0),"As long as they claimen dominion over this 
oasis, conflict is inevitable.",
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0080(0),I see.,
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0090(0),"The sword I bear makes me duty bound to 
protect the people of this town.",
TX_PC_RUD_A20300_0100(0),"'Tis a just cause. I, too, shalle standen by thy side.",
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0000(0),"That gentleman in charge of the town's guard is 
quite something.",
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0010(0),How so?,
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0020(0),"I mean he's a good man, gallant and brave.",
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0030(0),I did not think him your type.,
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0040(0),"Most women appreciate a man of courage. 
Someone you can trust in a crisis.",
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0050(0),"If he is what you say he is, he shall be a good 
ally.",
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0060(0),"I do say. After all, I've already figured out that 
you're good and gallant, too.",
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0080(0),See? I'm good at reading men.,
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0090(0),"In fact, I know you're the most trustworthy of 
all, and that's why I travel with you.",
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0100(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0110(0),Aw. You're blushing.,
TX_PC_RUD_0204D0_0120(0),...A vexing woman.,
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0000(0),"Olberic, your lordship.",
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0010(0),"That fellah looks like a tough customer. You 
sure you can handle him on your own?",
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0020(0),"I am confident. I have trained alongside Erhardt. I 
know my strengths...and weaknesses.",
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0030(0),"But you tell me. Are <span style=""italic"">you</> prepared for what is 
to come?",
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0040(0),Huh?,
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0050(0),"Great peril and danger await us. We shall need 
your help more than ever.",
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0060(0),"Hohohoho! You can count on me, don't you 
worry!",
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0070(0),I hope so.,
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0080(0),"I already said, I'm gonna be the first one into 
battle!",
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0090(0),"So c'mon, your lordship. Take a thumb out and 
let's get movin'!",
TX_PC_RUD_020500_0100(0),"My thumb is here in plain sight...but, yes. It is 
time to go.",
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0000(0),"I pray that the merciful Flame grant peace to 
their souls...",
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0010(0),You pray for the lizardmen?,
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0020(0),"Yes. To the townspeople, they are fearsome 
monsters that threaten their lives...",
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0030(0),"But they are living creatures for all that, and I 
would that they rest in peace.",
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0040(0),Just so.,
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0050(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0060(0),Ophilia. I have a favor to ask.,
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0070(0),What is it?,
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0080(0),Would you also pray for me?,
TX_PC_RUD_0206A0_0090(0),"Why, of course!",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0000(0),"So you've had your chat with him. Satisfied 
now?",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0010(0),Satisfied? I would not say that.,
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0020(0),But I have found...acceptance.,
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0030(0),"Erhardt slew the king. But how I choose to live 
<span style=""italic"">my</> life is up to me.",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0040(0),Uh-huh...,
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0050(0),"Does my heart soar? Have my troubles 
vanished? Nay. But I do see things more clearly 
now.",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0060(0),"I see what I need in order to wield my sword 
with a conscience clear.",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0070(0),"Hm... Never really gave much thought to what I 
do. I steal to live, simple as that.",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0080(0),"I get why you live the way you do, but...that 
lifestyle's just not for me.",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0090(0),"Likewise, I could not do what you do.",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0100(0),"However, I understand the choices that you 
make.",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0110(0),"You know, I never thought I'd see the day I'd be 
talking to a guy like you.",
TX_PC_RUD_020800_0120(0),"I suppose that's the beauty of going on a 
journey like this.",
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0000(0),Hehe.,
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0010(0),You looked pleased.,
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0020(0),I'm happy that you and Erhardt made up.,
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0030(0),Now you're comrades-in-arms again!,
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0040(0),It was a long road to reach such a point...,
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0050(0),"But fighters are straightforward men, and they 
understand each other.",
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0060(0),"Crossing swords just once can tell me more 
about another than a thousand words.",
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0070(0),Wow... That sounds incredible!,
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0080(0),"If you are interested in my world, I could teach 
you a little fencing.",
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0090(0),Really!? I'd love to be your prentice!,
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0100(0),"I'll be the best pupil you ever had, Sir Olberic! I 
promise you won't regret this!",
TX_PC_RUD_020900_0110(0),...I may already.,
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0000(0),"It's not every day you hear of a mercenary 
leader becoming a provincial lord.",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0010(0),Indeed.,
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0020(0),"He must have been very fortunate...or 
exceedingly clever.",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0030(0),"Don't be naive, Olberic.",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0040(0),"In this world, corruption and dirty dealings are 
the only way a man can rise that fast.",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0050(0),"Mark my words, his path to fortune is littered 
with the bodies of men with knives in their 
backs...",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0060(0),"And I don't just mean figuratively, either.",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0070(0),Yours is a most cynical outlook.,
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0080(0),"Trust me. I speak from experience. I know his 
type when I see it.",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0090(0),"You'd do well to know what you're getting into, 
if you're picking a fight with him.",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0100(0),Fear not.,
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0110(0),"When the swords are drawn, a corrupt man is 
cut down as easily as any other.",
TX_PC_RUD_030000_0120(0),Hehe. Then we've got nothing to worry about.,
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0000(0),"The town is in turmoil, which is exactly what I'd 
expect after seeing the behavior of those 
charged with policing it.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0010(0),"Still, it will be no small task getting at Werner.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0020(0),"A difficult foe, to be sure.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0030(0),"If there was ever a time when I was in need of 
a scholar's wisdom, it is now.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0040(0),Then it's most fortunate I am here now.,
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0050(0),"I do have some thoughts, as it happens...",
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0060(0),"An oppressive regime such as this is bound to 
foster discontent and dissatisfaction.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0070(0),"I suggest seeking out the victims. Find those 
who are most downtrodden, who are suffering 
the greatest. They will tell you what you need 
to know.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0080(0),I see. I shall do as you counsel.,
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0090(0),You will?,
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0100(0),"I trust your knowledge and insight. Else, I would 
have not asked.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30000_0110(0),"Well, then! It is an honor to be of service.",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0000(0),Burning people at the stake? How horrible!,
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0010(0),"It is a dreadful way to die. The final moments 
are agony...",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0020(0),"But that makes it all the more effective as a 
lesson to others.",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0030(0),"Those who would rule with terror must 
embrace terror.",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0040(0),"Wrongdoers need to be punished. Everyone 
agrees with that. But this goes beyond justice!",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0050(0),Just so.,
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0060(0),"I grow so sad, thinking about the poor people 
who live here.",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0070(0),"This cannot be allowed to go on. We have to do 
something.",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0080(0),"Agreed. Yet if we act too hastily, we shall lose 
all hope of saving them.",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0090(0),"We must have patience, if we are to prevail.",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0100(0),"So we just stand by and watch, is that it?",
TX_PC_RUD_030100_0110(0),It is hard to do so—but yes.,
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0000(0),"It's an evil thing, burnin' folk at the stake.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0010(0),"This damned Werner thinks of people's lives as 
nothin' more than firewood!",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0020(0),"...Tell me this, Alfyn.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0030(0),Do you value human life over firewood?,
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0040(0),Huh? What kinda crazy question is that?,
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0050(0),"I have taken the lives of more men than I care 
to remember.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0060(0),"Each time, I told myself that it mattered not. 
That it was insignificant.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0080(0),"The stuff we're made of, our flesh and blood, is 
fragile stuff. It turns to dust soon enough.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0090(0),"Not to get too poetical, but I've always thought 
that the fire—the life—in our bodies goes cold 
too soon.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0100(0),"So when I give folk medicine, I try my darndest 
to keep that fire alive.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0110(0),"So do I value life? Damned right I do. And so 
should you.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0120(0),"...Of course. Sometimes, in my line of work, a 
man can grow confused. Forget what's 
important.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0130(0),That is why I asked you. To remind me.,
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0140(0),"I'm most grateful you are here, Alfyn.",
TX_PC_RUD_A30100_0150(0),"Anytime you find yourself forgettin' what 
matters, you just talk to Alfyn, okay?",
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0000(0),...So this is how Werner chooses to rule.,
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0010(0),"He thinks he can intimidate people into 
obedience. And he's not wrong, either.",
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0020(0),"But it doesn't work on everyone. Some people 
don't scare easy.",
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0030(0),"Like you, for example.",
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0040(0),"Yeah, like me. When I was a kid, I had my share 
of beatings from people who thought they 
could break me.",
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0050(0),"But I'd shrug it off, and vowed that no one 
would ever tell <span style=""italic"">me</> what to do.",
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0060(0),"You are saying Harald and his friends are also 
such men.",
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0070(0),Maybe. But the question is—can you trust them?,
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0080(0),"The more men we can recruit to the cause, the 
better our chance of success.",
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0090(0),It's going to take more than just numbers.,
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0100(0),Agreed. But there are many ways to win a battle.,
TX_PC_RUD_030300_0110(0),"Heh, sounds like you have something up your 
sleeve. Color me interested.",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0000(0),...I doe not liken this.,
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0010(0),What's troubling you?,
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0020(0),It hath been too easy. Something is not right.,
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0030(0),"I knowe the plan is sound. I believe that it should 
succeed. Yet still...",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0040(0),"Something troubleth me, and I cannot reasonen 
it away.",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0050(0),"We would do well to listen to our instincts. They 
oft speak the truth.",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0060(0),"Is there anything you recall that gave rise to 
your suspicion?",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0070(0),"No. 'Tis just that...I feel like we aren deer being 
drawn into a hunter's trap.",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0080(0),"But our foe is a soldier, a man of war, and thou 
knowest his kind better than I.",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0090(0),"Soldier or beast, a hunter's instincts should 
never be ignored. I am grateful for the warning.",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0100(0),"Whatever may be, I shalle standen by thy side 
until this quest is complete.",
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0110(0),And I by yours.,
TX_PC_RUD_0304B0_0120(0),Let it be so.,
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0000(0),Yahoo! Erhardt saved the day!,
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0010(0),"...Only in the nick of time. He took far too long to 
reach us.",
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0020(0),"I thought we were all done for! I'm so glad he 
showed up when he did.",
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0030(0),"'Tis as if he deliberately left it to the last possible 
moment.",
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0040(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0050(0),...,
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0060(0),"You know, you don't have to be so serious all 
the time.",
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0070(0),"But I am not happy, either.",
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0080(0),"Are you sure about that? Because I'm pretty 
sure I saw you smiling back there.",
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0090(0),"You can't fool me, Sir Olberic.",
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0100(0),...Hmph. Let's go.,
TX_PC_RUD_030500_0110(0),"Hah! Men are so funny when they try to hide 
their feelings.",
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0000(0),"This smells like trade, I say!",
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0010(0),Hm? And what sort of smell wolde that be?,
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0020(0),"Hmm, how can I put it...?",
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0030(0),"The smell of wares flying off the shelves! Of 
coin, earned fair and square!",
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0040(0),Thou speakest of profit.,
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0050(0),"Well, yes. In a manner of speaking.",
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0060(0),"But trade is more than that. It's about 
<span style=""italic"">adventure</>—stories waiting to be told.",
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0070(0),"A nobler calling then, than the pursuit of base 
coin.",
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0080(0),Exactly!,
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0090(0),"If thou speakest the truth, I shalle joinen you in 
sniffing out this trade.",
TX_PC_ALI_010000_0100(0),Two noses are better than one!,
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0000(0),"A skystone, eh? A significant discovery, to be 
sure.",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0010(0),"Do you know much about skystones, Professor 
Albright?",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0020(0),"I daresay I've read a book or two about them. I 
can say they are a type of ore...",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0030(0),"But I failed to recognize the stone for what it 
was, even when put before me.",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0040(0),"But <span style=""italic"">your</> eyes saw true. Perhaps it is your 
merchant's instinct at work?",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0050(0),"Maybe! Honestly, I wasn't certain those rocks 
were so valuable...",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0060(0),"But in trade, good opportunities don't come by 
every day!",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0070(0),"So you just have to roll the dice when you see 
one.",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0080(0),...Indubitably.,
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0090(0),"I must confess, I was quite impressed at the 
way you managed to sell all those stones.",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0100(0),"Seeing the potential for trade in every part of 
life—you are a true merchant's merchant.",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0110(0),"It is a clever game you play, Tressa. I hope to 
see more of it.",
TX_PC_ALI_0101A0_0120(0),"It's a deal, Professor!",
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0000(0),Grrr...,
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0010(0),"I hate losing... It's so...so...<span style=""italic"">aggravating</>.",
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0020(0),...But you haven't lost. Not yet.,
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0030(0),I've been standing by you from the beginning...,
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0040(0),"And I know this isn't over yet. This is just a 
bump in the road.",
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0050(0),...Huh?,
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0060(0),"Look. You can't stomp off the stage over one 
mistake.",
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0070(0),"You have to push on. Fortune favors the 
brave—and the persistent!",
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0080(0),"What's gotten into you all of a sudden, Primrose?",
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0090(0),"Never mind that! Time to start afresh! Stock up 
new supplies! There's a world of deals waiting 
to be made!",
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0100(0),"Y-yes, ma'am!",
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0110(0),...,
TX_PC_ALI_010300_0120(0),"(Wow, talk about a rousing pep talk...)",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0000(0),This Ali fellow seems rather good at this...,
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0010(0),Grrr! I can't believe he got away with that!,
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0020(0),"I must confess, I've never met anyone so 
smooth of tongue.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0030(0),"In a way, it's hard not to admire him.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0040(0),"Ophilia! Whose side are you on, anyway!?",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0050(0),"Wh-why, yours, of course!",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0060(0),"This isn't over! I swear I'll make more coin than 
him before we're through!",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0070(0),"Just so! And I shall offer a blessing for your 
success.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0080(0),...Do you think I need to practice my sales pitch?,
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0090(0),"You mean, to be more persuasive like Ali?",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0100(0),"No, not like him <span style=""italic"">exactly</>... But if I did practice, 
maybe I'd be better at selling things...",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0110(0),"Er, well. I suppose it <span style=""italic"">could</> have just been 
practice that makes him sound so clever...",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0120(0),Exactly! So all I need to do is practice more.,
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0130(0),"In fact, I'll start now! You pretend to be the 
customer, all right?",
TX_PC_ALI_A10300_0140(0),W-wait...what!?,
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0000(0),Are you going to help Ali?,
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0010(0),That's the plan.,
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0020(0),"I thought he was your sworn enemy in the 
trading business.",
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0030(0),He was...and is. But only in business.,
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0040(0),"He hasn't been good for my sales, but it's not 
like I hate him as a person, you know?",
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0050(0),"Don't you think this is the perfect chance to get 
rid of a thorn in your side?",
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0060(0),"Maybe that's how thieves work, but not honest 
traders!",
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0070(0),"He gets on my nerves, for sure, but what's the 
point if I don't beat him fair and square!?",
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0080(0),...Suit yourself.,
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0090(0),"I'll not be taking advice from thieves, thank you 
very much.",
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0100(0),"She's got some steel in her bones, this one...",
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0110(0),Hm? Did you say something?,
TX_PC_ALI_010600_0120(0),Nothing important. Pay no mind to this thief.,
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0000(0),How low can you get!? I won't stand for this!,
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0010(0),"Calm yourself, Tressa.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0020(0),"He's going to pay, do you hear? Don't try to 
stop me!",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0030(0),"...I shall not. But at the very least, allow me to 
help you.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0040(0),"Better two than one, yes?",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0050(0),"...Truth be told, I was angry, too.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0060(0),"It was only the quickness of your temper that 
has allowed me to control mine.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0070(0),"Oh! Well, then you understand how I feel after all.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0080(0),"Thank you, Sir Olberic.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0090(0),"You need not thank me. We are comrades on 
this journey.",
TX_PC_ALI_A10600_0100(0),Hehe. You got that right!,
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0000(0),"Aw, shucks... Ain't that nice?",
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0010(0),Nice? What's nice?,
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0020(0),Makin' a new pal like that.,
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0030(0),"""Pal""? Surely you're not talking about Ali, my 
archrival!",
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0040(0),Hah! Who else would I be talking about?,
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0050(0),"Sure, you don't see eye-to-eye about 
everything.",
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0060(0),(Here he goes...),
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0070(0),"And you got off on the wrong foot with a little 
spat. I get it.",
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0080(0),"But you both eat from the same bowl, and ill 
fortune that hurts one of you hurts the other...",
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0090(0),"If that's not a foundation for friendship, I don't 
know what is!",
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0100(0),...,
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0110(0),"A promise to a true friend is as important as life 
itself. Remember that, Tress.",
TX_PC_ALI_010900_0120(0),"Er, I'll try not to forget...",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0000(0),"Tressa, whatever could this pirate treasure be?",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0010(0),"I'm not sure, but I'd love to find out!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0020(0),"Wouldn't it be amazing? Putting your faith in that 
ancient map, sailing the high seas, braving 
tempests and storms—",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0030(0),"Oh, yes! What an adventure that would be! Why, 
just imagining it has my heart all aflutter!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0040(0),"Ophilia? So you have the spirit of adventure in 
you, too!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0050(0),"I certainly do! Oh how I yearn for the romance 
of the open seas...",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0060(0),"When I was just a small girl, I'd often watch the 
boys playing at pirates...",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0070(0),"Oh, I used to play at pirates, too!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0080(0),"Cap'n Tressa, scourge of the seas!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0090(0),"Don't you know it! My motto was, ""Another day, 
another treasure!""",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0100(0),"I can see you now! Wearing a bandana and 
brandishing a wooden cutlass!",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0110(0),"...I overdid it at times. Sometimes the boys 
would break into tears and run home...",
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0120(0),...,
TX_PC_ALI_020000_0130(0),"...Yes, I can see that, too.",
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0000(0),"...You really want that map, don't you?",
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0010(0),I do. For Mr. Leon's sake.,
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0020(0),"I could steal it for you, you know.",
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0030(0),I'd rather you didn't. I can handle this myself.,
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0040(0),"He wants a trade, and he'll have it. That's what I 
do best.",
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0050(0),I'll show him who's the best merchant around!,
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0060(0),"Well, I see my help's not needed here.",
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0070(0),"Thought I'd act the gallant type, but clearly 
you're a lady who prefers the leading role.",
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0080(0),"You bet! After all, how could I call myself a real 
merchant if I refused this challenge?",
TX_PC_ALI_020200_0090(0),How indeed.,
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0000(0),"A shield for a map, is it...?",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0010(0),"What's got you down, H'aanit?",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0020(0),"I was merely pondering the worth of the shield 
and map. Aren they truly equal?",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0030(0),"Er, well. It <span style=""italic"">was</> a nice shield. Very sturdy.",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0040(0),"No loss on the trade, then?",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0050(0),Well...maybe a little.,
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0060(0),"But as I see it, this old map is very important to 
Mr. Leon.",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0070(0),"So it hath greater value to him, then.",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0080(0),"That's right. One person's trash is another 
person's treasure, after all.",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0090(0),"It doesn't matter what price I put on 
something—it's what others'll pay that matters. 
That's what trade's all about.",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0100(0),Then it taketh two parties to setten a price?,
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0110(0),"...I hadde not considered that. There aren depths 
to thy work I hadde never imagined.",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0120(0),"Don't you know it! As interesting as hunting 
beasts, wouldn't you say?",
TX_PC_ALI_020300_0130(0),I wolde have to agree...,
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0000(0),"So they were friends, I see...",
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0010(0),...,
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0020(0),"What is it, Tressa?",
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0030(0),"Well, it sounds like Mr. Leon and Mr. Baltazar got 
along so well.",
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0040(0),"If they had worked together as pirates, they 
would've been unbeatable!",
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0050(0),So why did they insist on being rivals instead?,
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0060(0),"Mayhap they vied with each other precisely 
because they admired each other so.",
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0070(0),"When a man of action meets another, his first 
instinct is to prove himself better.",
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0080(0),I understand well the hearts of men like Leon...,
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0090(0),(I once felt the same about Erhardt...),
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0100(0),...,
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0110(0),"What is it this time? You're a thoughtful one 
today...",
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0120(0),The look on your face just now...,
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0130(0),"It reminded me so much of Mr. Leon's face, 
when he talked about Mr. Baltazar.",
TX_PC_ALI_0205C0_0140(0),Oho... Is that so?,
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0000(0),"Eldrite, the ore of legend...",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0010(0),"You know of it, Professor Albright?",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0020(0),"Oh yes. Otherwise known as the Eye of the Sea. 
So beautiful, men liken it to the eye of a 
goddess...",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0030(0),"...Or so my tomes tell me. I have never observed 
an actual specimen with my own eyes, mind you.",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0040(0),"It is also written that you can see an ocean 
inside, if you peer long enough.",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0050(0),"A whole ocean? With fish and seaweed and 
everything?",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0060(0),"Ahaha. I would be surprised, to say the least, if 
the view offered quite so much detail.",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0070(0),"Truth be told, all the accounts are hearsay. Not 
one author has claimed to have found one of 
the stones.",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0080(0),"Though not for want of effort—it has long 
been sought after by pirates, kings, and would-
be treasure hunters.",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0090(0),"...And me! Suddenly, I <span style=""italic"">really</> want to find it!",
TX_PC_ALI_A205C0_0100(0),"Ahaha, now that's the spirit!",
TX_PC_ALI_020700_0000(0),"Quite a treasure, indeed.",
TX_PC_ALI_020700_0010(0),Don't I know it!,
TX_PC_ALI_020700_0020(0),May I see it?,
TX_PC_ALI_020700_0030(0),"Why, it's stunning.",
TX_PC_ALI_020700_0040(0),"When I was younger, I had occasion to set eyes 
on many a beautiful stone.",
TX_PC_ALI_020700_0050(0),"But I've never seen one of such profound clarity 
and color.",
TX_PC_ALI_020700_0060(0),"Heh, you can say that again!",

TX_PC_ALI_020700_0130(0),"Oh, yes. I mean, you can see right through it. 
Utterly transparent.",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0000(0),...Thanks?,
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0010(0),"Hey there, Tress. What's with the serious look?",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0020(0),"I was just thinking about what my most 
precious treasure could be.",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0030(0),"Tell me, Alfyn. What do <span style=""italic"">you</> treasure the most?",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0040(0),"Me? Shucks, I'd rather not say. It's kind of silly, 
to be honest.",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0050(0),"Oh, come now. What are you acting so 
embarrassed about?",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0060(0),It's not that. It's just...,
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0070(0),"Besides, I know the answer. It's that bag.",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0080(0),...!,
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0090(0),"You always keep it in your sight, and you're 
constantly cleaning and mending it.",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0100(0),...You got me. A good pal of mine gave it to me.,
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0110(0),"When I've got it slung over my back, it's like I 
can hear him whispering in my ear.",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0120(0),"""You brew those potions of yours with pride, 
you hear?"" he says.",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0130(0),"And I listen, too. That's why I put so much care 
into my concoctions.",
TX_PC_ALI_020800_0140(0),"Hehe. Now that's a true treasure if I ever heard 
of one!",
TX_PC_ALI_030000_0000(0),Taking it all in?,
TX_PC_ALI_030000_0010(0),You bet I am!,

one thing to the next...",

Ornate metal filigree showing the touch of a

TX_PC_ALI_030000_0050(0),"And those ceramics! It's not every day you see 
such pristine craftsmanship.",
TX_PC_ALI_030000_0060(0),"...You mean those cups and bowls? How 
valuable can they be?",
TX_PC_ALI_030000_0070(0),"Well, they're made of the finest white porcelain! 
Very rare, <span style=""italic"">very</> costly.",
TX_PC_ALI_030000_0080(0),...Heh. You know your stuff.,
TX_PC_ALI_030000_0090(0),"As do you! When it comes to jewelry, at least.",

last long in the profession.",

we thought.",

TX_PC_ALI_A30000_0090(0),Is something the matter?,
TX_PC_ALI_A30000_0100(0),Forgiven me.,

the trinkets themselves.",

happenstance. Fate played its hand.",
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0030(0),I want her to know happiness.,
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0040(0),It took a lot of courage for her to come this far.,
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0050(0),"It just goes to show that money can't solve 
everything.",
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0060(0),Indeed. We all have our own troubles and cares.,
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0070(0),...And things we treasure.,
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0080(0),Yes.,
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0090(0),"I can't say I know exactly what Noa is searching 
for...",
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0100(0),But I sure hope she finds it.,
TX_PC_ALI_0301A0_0110(0),...As do I.,
TX_PC_ALI_A301A0_0000(0),"The Wyndham family... But of course they'd 
come to the Fair.",
TX_PC_ALI_A301A0_0010(0),"Do you know of the Wyndhams, Professor?",
TX_PC_ALI_A301A0_0020(0),"Yes. But in a different way, I posit, than a 
merchant such as yourself.",

TX_PC_ALI_A301A0_0050(0),"The Wyndhams have witnessed great changes in 
the arts and in politics, and have recorded that 
history in their family chronicles.",

be grateful to them.",

and that's what makes trade so fascinating!",
TX_PC_ALI_A301A0_0130(0),"Indubitably. And scholarship, too, I might add.",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0000(0),Hmmm...,
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0010(0),"What is it, Alfyn?",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0020(0),"I was just thinking. That Ali's an awfully good 
fellow, don't you think?",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0030(0),"I wouldn't mind sharing a mug or two of mead 
with him...",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0040(0),He's too young for the alehouse!,
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0050(0),"Ahahaha! When you put it like that, I suppose he 
is.",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0060(0),"But I have a feeling you two would get along 
just fine. Why don't you become partners?",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0070(0),...Partners?,
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0080(0),"You could make the medicine, and he could sell 
it for you. You'd both be rich in no time!",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0090(0),"Ahaha! Golly, why didn't I think of that?",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0100(0),"I bet Ali could fetch five times the coin that you 
manage to get.",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0110(0),I don't doubt that for a second.,

for your medicine?",
TX_PC_ALI_030300_0130(0),"What? I never gave it much thought. 
Just...whatever feels right at the time, you

merchant... Don't.",
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0000(0),Do you think he'll be all right?,
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0010(0),Are you worried for the lad?,
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0020(0),"Of course. He's putting himself into danger, all 
for my sake.",
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0030(0),He swore he would pay his debt.,
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0040(0),"I know, but...",
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0050(0),And I believe him a man of his word.,
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0060(0),"His pride wouldn't stand for owing me anything, 
that's for sure.",
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0070(0),I just hope he doesn't get himself hurt...,
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0080(0),...As do I.,
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0090(0),"But whether you fret or not, he will do what he 
has set his mind to.",
TX_PC_ALI_030400_0100(0),"I guess you're right. And he <span style=""italic"">is</> tougher than he 
looks.",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0010(0),Are you nervous? Because you look it.,
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0020(0),"I've never done anything like this before. Not in 
front of so many people.",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0030(0),"Then let me give you a tip, from one who's 
spent her fair share of time on stage...",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0040(0),Just imagine everyone is a fish.,
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0050(0),...A fish?,
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0060(0),"Yes. You, the audience, everyone. A fish. And 
the hall is a vast ocean.",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0070(0),"Out in the ocean, with so many fish swimming 
around, no cares about any particular fish.",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0080(0),...,
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0090(0),Especially a teensy little minnow like yourself.,
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0100(0),"Wait... What do you mean, ""teensy""!?",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0110(0),"Anyway. That's what I do when I'm on stage. 
Imagine myself as a fish, swimming in the 
endless sea...",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0120(0),"Fish, huh? Well, I'll give it a try...",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0130(0),"Thank you, Primrose.",
TX_PC_ALI_0307A0_0140(0),"Any time, dear. Now break a leg! ...Or a fin?",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0000(0),"Professor, may I ask what that letter was 
about? It seemed most engrossing.",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0010(0),"Oh, that? It was a message warning me about 
women.",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0020(0),...Huh?,
TX_PC_THE_010000_0030(0),Oh. I don't mean in a bad way.,
TX_PC_THE_010000_0040(0),"What it actually said was that I should be careful 
how I act toward women, lest I give cause for 
misunderstandings.",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0050(0),"Well, intelligence such as yours can be very 
attractive...",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0060(0),"Please, my dear.",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0070(0),"A word such as ""attractive"" must be kept in 
reserve for those of great beauty—such as 
yourself.",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0080(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_010000_0090(0),Erm...,
TX_PC_THE_010000_0100(0),Hm?,
TX_PC_THE_010000_0110(0),"I think maybe that's the kind of thing the letter 
writer was talking about...",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0120(0),"You think so? But I was merely speaking my 
mind.",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0130(0),"Am I not allowed to tell a beautiful woman that 
she is just that?",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0140(0),"Well, sometimes you can...but maybe, in your 
case, you shouldn't.",
TX_PC_THE_010000_0150(0),Tsk. I am finding this most difficult to understand.,
TX_PC_THE_010200_0000(0),"So, Professor. Think you can solve the puzzle?",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0010(0),"Oh, definitely. I am very much looking forward 
to the challenge!",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0020(0),"Hehe. Your enthusiasm certainly is charming, but 
don't you find the scholarly life to 
be...exhausting sometimes?",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0030(0),"You must forgive me, but I don't see how it 
possibly could be.",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0040(0),"Well, you lot can never let a mystery just be. 
You need to figure everything out...",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0050(0),"You realize there's no end to it? That you'll 
never find all the answers?",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0060(0),"Life is too short to spend it with a furrowed 
brow and a nose forever stuck in a tome.",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0070(0),"Ah. Clearly, you are not a fan of natural 
philosophy.",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0080(0),"Still, I enjoy your refreshing frankness. There's a 
certain beauty to your honesty.",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0090(0),"Steady, Professor. Are you trying to sweet-talk 
me?",
TX_PC_THE_010200_0100(0),What do you mean?,
TX_PC_THE_010200_0110(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_010200_0120(0),"(I honestly can't tell if he's genuinely guileless, or 
just play-acting...)",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0010(0),"Er, Professor?",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0030(0),He-LLOOO! Professor!,
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0040(0),"...Ah, hello, Tressa. Why are you shouting?",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0050(0),"I was trying to offer you some sweets, but you 
weren't answering me.",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0060(0),"Oh, I do apologize.",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0070(0),"Once I get to thinking about a thing, I oft become 
lost to the world.",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0080(0),"There was a time when I was so engrossed in a 
book, I failed to notice that my neighbor's house 
was on fire.",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0090(0),"W-wow... Being able to concentrate like that 
must be super handy as a scholar!",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0100(0),"But it's probably best to be a liiittle more 
attentive, especially when on the road like we 
are. You never know what's waiting around the 
next corner!",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0110(0),"Quite true, Tressa, quite true. I shall endeavor to 
be more vigilant.",
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0120(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_0103B0_0130(0),"(She praises my focus, but it's nothing 
compared to hers when she's in the midst of a 
business negotiation.)",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0000(0),"...It looks like someone's been coming in and out 
of these sewers.",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0010(0),As we suspected.,
TX_PC_THE_010400_0020(0),"Muddy footprints on the floor and handprints on 
the wall.",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0030(0),"Recent, too. The mud is still wet.",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0040(0),I see. That is very useful information.,
TX_PC_THE_010400_0050(0),"I must say, you have a keen eye, to spot such 
subtle signs.",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0060(0),It's just experience.,
TX_PC_THE_010400_0070(0),"Albeit experience I never thought would be 
useful to <span style=""italic"">you</>... Heh.",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0080(0),"Your experience is the result of careful study, 
and gives you valuable skills. You see...",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0090(0),"Oh, but we don't have time for a discussion 
now, however interesting. Perhaps I'll share my 
insights later.",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0100(0),"Don't worry about it. Your lectures give me a 
headache.",
TX_PC_THE_010400_0110(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_010400_0120(0),Too honest?,
TX_PC_THE_010400_0130(0),"A little, yes.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0000(0),"I care not to boast...but I have experience in 
hunting wild goats.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0010(0),Oh? Now that's interesting...,
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0020(0),"Their fur and hide aren highly valued—especially 
when unmarred by wounds.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0030(0),"Instead of using a bow, I oft builde traps when I 
hunte goats.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0040(0),I see...,
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0050(0),"I stalke the quarry, then herde it toward my pit 
or snare until it is caught.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0060(0),"Different means for different prey. Hunting is 
not as simple as it seems.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0070(0),"In all things, thou must finden the proper way to 
achieven thy goal.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0080(0),"Wouldst thou eaten soup with a fork? Steak 
with a spoon?",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0090(0),"Excellent examples, both. You state your case 
most persuasively.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0100(0),"You have a talent for teaching. Perhaps it is 
something you might pursue, in the future.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0110(0),"Me, a teacher? I thinke not.",
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0120(0),You seem very sure about that.,
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0130(0),I prefere the hunt.,
TX_PC_THE_0108A0_0140(0),"Well, pedagogy's loss is hunting's gain, I dare say.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0010(0),"Alfyn, my friend. You seem...melancholy.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0020(0),It's nothin'.,
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0030(0),"Yet I am worried that it is, in fact, something.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0040(0),"Well. I can't stop thinkin' about them poor folk 
that got sacrificed.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0050(0),It's an awful thing. People ain't tools to be used!,
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0060(0),"Knowledge is a tool that can serve noble ends 
or wicked, depending on who wields it.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0070(0),"What matters is the nature of the person who 
uses the tool...the disposition of their heart.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0080(0),"Yours, for example, is full of goodness, and I 
believe that any knowledge is safe in your hands.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0090(0),"Aw, leave off it, Professor. I've got my brain full 
just tryin' to learn all I can about medicine.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0100(0),"In any case, I feel sick thinkin' about all this. I 
need to wash my hands or somethin'.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0110(0),Use this.,
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0120(0),"A handkerchief? Thank you, Professor.",
TX_PC_THE_A108A0_0130(0),"(...Hmm. I believe I shall learn much from this 
man.)",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_010900_0010(0),"Is something troubling you, my friend? You 
suddenly have a worried look about you.",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0020(0),"Don't stop, and don't look back—but I feel eyes 
upon us.",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0030(0),"Someone watching, you mean? Hmm... It would 
well behoove us to trust your instincts...",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0040(0),"The question is, who?",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0050(0),"Let us drag them out of hiding and find out. 
Compel them to confess their intentions.",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0060(0),"We could try. But if they escape, we will only 
have served to alert them...",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0070(0),Then only one other avenue is open to us.,
TX_PC_THE_010900_0080(0),What would that be?,
TX_PC_THE_010900_0090(0),"Continue on our way, pretending that we have 
noticed nothing, and let them make the first 
move.",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0100(0),"If that be your advice, so be it.",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0110(0),"But you must be our lookout. Do not let your 
guard slip.",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0120(0),"Hehe. Knowing one's enemy is the first step to 
defeating him.",
TX_PC_THE_010900_0130(0),"I cannot tell if you are courageous...or ignorant 
of the danger.",
TX_PC_THE_020000_0000(0),"Take care, Scholar.",
TX_PC_THE_020000_0010(0),"You know, I feel it now, too. The unmistakable 
sense of being watched...",
TX_PC_THE_020000_0020(0),"For my part, the feeling was faint at first, and 
came and went. But it grows stronger with 
every step we take.",
TX_PC_THE_020000_0030(0),"Undoubtedly, your instincts are sharper than 
mine. How did you acquire them, I wonder.",
TX_PC_THE_020000_0040(0),I cannot say.,
TX_PC_THE_020000_0050(0),"It is something I learned on the battlefield. By 
what means, I do not rightly know.",
TX_PC_THE_020000_0060(0),Oh. I was hoping there was some easy trick to it.,
TX_PC_THE_020000_0070(0),"It is easy enough—if you are willing to fight as 
many battles as I have.",
TX_PC_THE_020000_0080(0),"I think ""easy"" here means something different to 
you and me.",
TX_PC_THE_020000_0090(0),Fair enough.,
TX_PC_THE_020000_0100(0),"Even a scholar such as yourself cannot know 
everything there is to know of this world.",
TX_PC_THE_020100_0000(0),So you were refused.,
TX_PC_THE_020100_0010(0),"Indeed. It would appear we have no one to rely 
upon but ourselves.",
TX_PC_THE_020100_0020(0),"This Dominic fellow. Stubborn coot, wouldn't 
you say?",
TX_PC_THE_020100_0030(0),"A type regrettably common in the world of 
philosophy and science.",
TX_PC_THE_020100_0040(0),So you're going to find out more about him?,
TX_PC_THE_020100_0050(0),"Certainly. If I can do that, I might find a means by 
which to make him listen to me.",
TX_PC_THE_020100_0060(0),"I shall start by talking to his colleagues and 
other associates.",
TX_PC_THE_020100_0070(0),"Good luck. Those bookish types are battier than 
the Carrion Caves.",
TX_PC_THE_020100_0080(0),Myself included?,
TX_PC_THE_020100_0090(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_020100_0100(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0000(0),He refuseth to talken to thee.,
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0010(0),Quite. I need a different approach.,
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0030(0),"You are looking most solemn. Is anything 
troubling you?",
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0040(0),"...I was thinking. Wherefore wolde someone so 
mighty turneth his back on others?",
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0050(0),"The suffering in his voice was that of a man 
who hath been made to forsaken everything.",
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0060(0),"You are suggesting there is a reason for his 
behavior.",
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0070(0),Perhaps. I knowe not...,
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0080(0),But when I think about the life that he hath led...,
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0090(0),"Yes, quite.",
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0100(0),"Something tragic may have befallen him... I need 
to find out more.",
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0110(0),Perhaps I can even find a way to help him.,
TX_PC_THE_A20100_0120(0),A good plan. Leten us acten upon it.,
TX_PC_THE_020300_0000(0),"Can I ask you a question, Professor?",
TX_PC_THE_020300_0010(0),By all means.,
TX_PC_THE_020300_0020(0),"What kind of things did you teach back at the 
palace?",
TX_PC_THE_020300_0030(0),"Interested in a spot of learning, are we? Then 
pull up a log and I'll give you a lesson.",
TX_PC_THE_020300_0040(0),Huh!?,
TX_PC_THE_020300_0050(0),"History. Let's begin there. Specifically, with the 
founding of the mighty Kingdom of Hornburg...",
TX_PC_THE_020300_0060(0),W-wait! I never said—!,
TX_PC_THE_020300_0070(0),And there followed...and also... In short...,
TX_PC_THE_020300_0080(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_020300_0090(0),"(He's been talking for an hour now! I'm not sure 
whether to be annoyed or impressed...)",
TX_PC_THE_020300_0100(0),"But the king—Edbart, if you recall—had his own 
worries. You see...",
TX_PC_THE_020300_0110(0),"Professor, can I say something?",
TX_PC_THE_020300_0120(0),"What is it, Tressa?",
TX_PC_THE_020300_0130(0),"We <span style=""italic"">really</> need to get back on the road.",
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0000(0),I won't let him get away with this!,
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0010(0),"I don't care who you are, kidnappin' and holdin' 
someone hostage ain't right!",
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0020(0),"Alfyn, my friend. I oft find you overly hot-
headed and temperamental...",
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0030(0),"But on this issue, I stand in complete agreement.",
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0040(0),"Why, no man who pretends to integrity and 
virtuousness can let such wrongdoing go 
unpunished!",
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0050(0),"Shucks, Professor. Never seen you get so hot 
under the collar afore.",
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0060(0),"I assure I am quite calm, and my sub-collar 
temperature remains tepid.",
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0070(0),"All right, if you say so. Either way, let's get goin'!",
TX_PC_THE_0205A0_0080(0),"Indeed, Alfyn. We must make haste.",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0000(0),Therese seems like a good girl.,
TX_PC_THE_020800_0010(0),"She's got spirit and pluck, and would follow you 
to the end of the world and back, it seems.",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0020(0),"I remember times when I've been as filled with 
passion as she.",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0030(0),...?,
TX_PC_THE_020800_0040(0),"Hehe. But then I don't have to tell you what's 
what. Right, Professor?",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0050(0),I'm afraid I'm not sure to what you are alluding...,
TX_PC_THE_020800_0060(0),"I'm just saying, she's come all this way for your 
sake...",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0070(0),"Oh, indeed. She is a most dedicated and 
conscientious student.",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0080(0),"That she would make such a journey out of 
worry for her professor's health is a credit to 
her.",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0090(0),I think you're missing the point...,
TX_PC_THE_020800_0100(0),"Nothing thrills a scholar's heart quite like a 
student so utterly dedicated to her studies.",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0110(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_020800_0120(0),"Is something the matter, Primrose?",
TX_PC_THE_020800_0130(0),No. I think I just had the wrong end of the stick...,
TX_PC_THE_020900_0000(0),"Professor, that monster...",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0010(0),You speak of Headmaster Yvon.,
TX_PC_THE_020900_0020(0),"Yes. H-he seemed just a normal person, and 
then...",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0030(0),"Some monsters are created in laboratories. So 
it is certainly possibly to transform a man into 
one.",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0040(0),"There will always be people prepared to use 
knowledge for vile ends...",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0050(0),I never thought knowledge to be so...frightening.,
TX_PC_THE_020900_0060(0),"Yes. But remember that while it can serve evil, it 
is also the weapon we need to defeat that same 
evil.",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0070(0),"You mean, it all depends on who uses it.",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0080(0),Precisely.,
TX_PC_THE_020900_0090(0),"That is why, you see, the pursuit of knowledge 
demands virtue and integrity.",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0100(0),"Knowledge nobly won can be shared for the 
benefit of all men.",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0110(0),"I warrant that if it had been you who'd found 
that knowledge...",
TX_PC_THE_020900_0120(0),...you would have known how to use it for good.,
TX_PC_THE_020900_0130(0),"Such glowing praise! You flatter me, dear lady.",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0000(0),So our journey bringeth us to Duskbarrow.,
TX_PC_THE_030000_0010(0),"Ah, yes. You are from this region, are you not?",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0020(0),"Aye. Though I have never visited the town, I've 
heard tell of it.",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0030(0),It is famous for the many ruins that surround it.,
TX_PC_THE_030000_0040(0),Many of them daten from the age of legends.,
TX_PC_THE_030000_0050(0),"The age of legends, you say. A thousand years 
in the past...",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0060(0),"For their age, the structures are remarkably 
well preserved.",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0070(0),Master once tolde me a story of the ruins.,
TX_PC_THE_030000_0080(0),"He saide that whenever danger or disaster is 
visited upon Duskbarrow, the people taken 
shelter in the ruins.",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0090(0),"Whatever era they weren built, they weren built 
strong, using techniques no longer known.",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0100(0),"Lost architectural techniques, you say. My 
interest is piqued.",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0110(0),"I'm inclined to investigate—after, of course, we 
have settled this affair of Headmaster Yvon.",
TX_PC_THE_030000_0120(0),Thou art confident of our success...,
TX_PC_THE_030000_0130(0),I always am.,
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0000(0),"Color me impressed, Professor.",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0010(0),To what are you referring?,
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0020(0),Finding the hidden door back there.,
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0030(0),"It was no great thing. I enjoy coming up with 
little theories and then testing them...",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0040(0),"It's a useful talent. If you ever have mind to 
switch trades, you could make a go of thievery.",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0050(0),"Me, a bandit? Now that would be amusing.",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0060(0),"But if I do fall onto hard times in the scholarly 
world, I shall apply to become your prentice.",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0070(0),"Hate to disappoint you, but I'm not the teaching 
type. I learned by watching and doing.",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0080(0),"Observation and practice, in other words. That is 
the essence of all learning.",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0090(0),"If you ever took it upon yourself to become a 
scholar, I would certainly vouch for you.",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0100(0),"...I appreciate the offer, but I think I'm allergic to 
academia.",
TX_PC_THE_0301G0_0110(0),"(Though if he'd caught me when I was still 
young, things might've been different...)",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0000(0),"Would you help me satisfy my curiosity, Alfyn?",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0010(0),"Specifically, I am wondering why you make 
medicines.",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0020(0),Huh?,
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0030(0),"I mean, I have never met an apothecary quite so 
dedicated to his trade.",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0040(0),"You could use your talents to win riches, or 
honor, or renown...",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0050(0),"Yet, you forget to ask for fees, make no claim 
on those you help...",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0060(0),"Frankly, I find it unfathomable.",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0070(0),"Aw, shucks. I just like helpin' folk who're in 
trouble.",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0080(0),"Right. Question answered—let's go, Professor!",
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0090(0),...,
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0100(0),Professor?,
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0110(0),(I asked what I thought was a difficult question...),
TX_PC_THE_A301G0_0120(0),"(Yet he gives me a plain answer, without 
hesitation. A clever man, this Alfyn...)",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0000(0),"Did you learn anything about those wall 
paintings?",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0010(0),"A little, yes. For example, they clearly date from 
ancient times.",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0020(0),"I believe that they have religious significance of 
some kind.",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0030(0),"But I saw nothing in them of the teachings of 
the Sacred Flame.",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0040(0),"The beliefs in the age of legends were quite 
different from today. It was a time before the 
religious schism.",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0050(0),"You mean, even before the Sacred Flame 
teachings began?",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0060(0),"Precisely so. An age almost entirely unknown to 
us...",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0070(0),"A time when gods and mortals walked together 
upon the soil...",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0080(0),"I am blessed indeed, to have been given the 
chance to visit these ruins. They are a scholar's 
paradise...",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0090(0),"I'm glad, too. It almost feels like I can hear the 
thoughts of the people who lived long ago.",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0100(0),"The very breath of the ancients, borne on the 
wind over these many long centuries...",
TX_PC_THE_030200_0110(0),...Whispering of great and epic tales.,
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0000(0),Those paintings scare me.,
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0010(0),I don't think I've seen anything quite so...spooky.,
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0020(0),"My mother used to like art. She filled the house 
with paintings and pictures...",
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0030(0),Oh? What kind of pictures?,
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0040(0),"There was one I remember vividly. It showed a 
girl standing in a sea of grass.",
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0050(0),"I'd stare at it so long I thought I could see the 
grass moving in the wind. I'll never forget it.",
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0060(0),Hm. Most interesting.,
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0070(0),"Yearning, passion, sorrow, hate, one's very 
essence...",
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0080(0),"In every artwork, we can feel the soul of the 
person who painted it.",
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0090(0),...So what kind of soul is in those paintings?,
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0100(0),"Hm. Nothing too awful, I hope...",
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0110(0),"But I confess that I am looking forward to 
cracking the puzzle.",
TX_PC_THE_A30200_0120(0),"Glad someone can get enjoyment out of them. 
Because I certainly can't.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0000(0),Are these tomes really worth so much?,
TX_PC_THE_030300_0010(0),"I can assure you that if they become known, 
they will turn the world of scholarship on its 
head.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0020(0),"It is not surprising to learn that knowledge can 
be lost with the passing of time.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0030(0),"Wars, disasters, and fires have all served to 
make men forget things they once knew.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0040(0),"Yet books thought to be gone forever have 
returned as if from the dead.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0050(0),"Which implies they were stolen. Deliberately kept 
from the world.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0060(0),Indeed. A most deplorable crime.,
TX_PC_THE_030300_0070(0),"And the culprit is this man, Yvon.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0080(0),"He would make all knowledge his, and his alone. 
That is why he hid it away here...",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0090(0),"Unlike men, books cannot talk. What tales these 
forsaken tomes would tell.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0100(0),Forsaken. That is exactly the word.,
TX_PC_THE_030300_0110(0),"To monopolize knowledge in this way is a 
desecration of scholarship itself.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0120(0),Spoken like a man truly devoted to his trade.,
TX_PC_THE_030300_0130(0),"It is only proper that an honorable scholar such 
as you cast his eyes over these pages once 
more.",
TX_PC_THE_030300_0140(0),...I intend to do just that.,
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0000(0),Professor?,
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0010(0),"What is it, Tressa?",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0020(0),"I was just thinking about the books here. They 
all seem very...special.",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0030(0),"How much are they worth, do you think?",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0040(0),"Ah, Tressa. We can always trust you to be 
interested in the worth of things.",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0050(0),"Those books record the history of all that has 
happened. Every event, from beginning to end.",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0060(0),Gosh...,
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0070(0),"In other words, they contain the knowledge of 
the world. Knowledge won at the cost of 
uncounted lives.",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0080(0),"Whoa! I don't think even <span style=""italic"">I</> could put a price on 
that!",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0090(0),"Quite. They are without question priceless—for 
they belong to all men.",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0100(0),"Then maybe we should make lots of copies and 
sell them cheaply so that as many people as 
possible can read them!",
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0110(0),A splendid idea.,
TX_PC_THE_A30300_0120(0),"The question then becomes, how does one 
produce books cheaply and in large quantities?",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0000(0),Whyever didst Hägen reacten in such a manner?,
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0010(0),...An astute question.,
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0020(0),"If I may posit... Hägen is of a species known as 
the direwolf, yes?",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0030(0),"It is said that a wolf's sense of smell is one 
hundred million times more sensitive than that 
of man.",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0040(0),"...And amongst wolves, direwolves have the 
most sensitive noses of all.",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0050(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0060(0),"I would posit that when he entered the city, he 
was overwhelmed by all the smells common to 
such a bustling center of activity.",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0070(0),"And yet, of all those odors, he would be most 
sensitive to those he is most familiar with. To 
wit...",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0080(0),Hast thou a point?,
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0090(0),"Er, I was just getting there. To wit, he detected a 
certain scent.",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0100(0),"Namely, the scent belonging to...",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0110(0),...Master. Of course. Then we must maken haste.,
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0120(0),"Ah, er...yes. Precisely.",
TX_PC_MAR_0100B0_0130(0),"Thou shouldst not losen heart. I will listenen to 
one of thy lectures after our job is done.",
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0000(0),The sheer nerve of that man!,
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0010(0),Thou canst sayen that again...,
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0020(0),"Consider yourself warned, H'aanit. Stay well 
clear of self-centered men!",
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0030(0),"I have little experience with menfolk. Aside from 
my master, of course...",
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0040(0),"But thou hast experience in abundance. Praye 
tellen me of their ways.",
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0050(0),I suppose I know a thing or two...,
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0060(0),"All right. There are two kinds of men in this 
world.",
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0070(0),"Those who devote themselves to their trade or 
calling, and spare little thought for the fairer 
sex...",
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0080(0),"...And those that have no time at all for work, 
but plenty for pleasure.",
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0090(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0100(0),"...If that is my choice, I shall take neither.",
TX_PC_MAR_010100_0110(0),"Why, H'aanit. It would seem you don't need my 
counsel after all.",
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0000(0),...So Master Z'aanta's like a father to you.,
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0010(0),"You know, I was thinking about my own father 
the other day.",
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0020(0),...And?,
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0030(0),"He once got so angry at me, I decided to run 
away from home.",
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0040(0),"I ate some sugar from his stores, you see. I 
didn't see why that was so bad—we had plenty, 
after all.",
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0050(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0060(0),"Anyhow, the next day I came slinking back, my 
belly rumbling.",
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0070(0),"Sure enough, Pa was waiting for me...with a big 
bowl of sugar he said was my dinner.",
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0080(0),You can bet I begged for his forgiveness then!,
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0090(0),Hehe. Your father soundeth like a good man.,
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0100(0),"You're worried, aren't you? About Master 
Z'aanta, I mean.",
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0110(0),"Well, you shouldn't be. It'll turn out all right in the 
end. Just you see.",
TX_PC_MAR_010300_0120(0),"Thanks be to thee, Tressa.",
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0000(0),...So. You know where to go next.,
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0010(0),Yes. From the moment I sawe the landslide.,
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0020(0),"Impressive. Though I guess a hunter's most at 
home in the woods, eh?",
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0030(0),"Thanks be to my training. My master hath 
taught me well.",
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0040(0),...I hear there's no fiend he couldn't slay.,
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0050(0),"As a hunter, he is without peer. But...",
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0060(0),But?,
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0070(0),"When he ventureth into town, he is too easily 
tempted by the alehouse and games of chance.",
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0080(0),He lacketh anything resembling discipline.,
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0090(0),"...Sounds to me like you're being a bit harsh on 
him.",
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0100(0),Harsh? However so?,
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0110(0),"Even the best of men fall prey to the 
temptations of the city.",
TX_PC_MAR_010400_0120(0),"So it truly is more fearsome than the deepest 
of forests...",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0010(0),Your master is an impressive man.,
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0020(0),...Hm?,
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0030(0),"It is in our most trying moments that our true 
character is revealed.",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0040(0),"Your master refused to yield, even as his limbs 
turned to solid stone.",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0050(0),"There are few with the wits to know what 
must be done at such a time, and fewer still 
with the composure to act upon it.",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0060(0),"Through his courage, he instilled in you the gift 
of hope.",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0070(0),"If that is not greatness, then I know not what is.",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0080(0),"...Truth be told, I have ne'er heard such praise 
bestowed upon him.",

can sit down and share a drink.",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0100(0),"...Best not. Thou shouldst know that he turneth 
most tedious when the mead starteth flowing.",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0110(0),"Endless tall tales of the great beasts he hath 
hunted, each repeated thrice for good measure.",
TX_PC_MAR_010600_0120(0),"...I see. Perhaps just soup and barley tea, then.",
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0000(0),I've heard much of this Eliza.,
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0010(0),"...Ah, indeed. The Knights Ardante aren servants 
of thine Order, yes?",
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0020(0),"Indeed. She is well respected by the church, and 
known as one of its most loyal servants.",
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0030(0),"'Tis a terrible waste that she maintaineth this 
friendship with my master.",
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0040(0),"She honoreth him with her company, yet he is 
naught but a source of vexation and worry.",
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0050(0),"She is a noble and beautiful woman. Wolde that I 
coulde be more like that...",
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0060(0),"I know what you mean. She is a role model to 
us all.",
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0070(0),Truly? Even a beauty such as thyself?,
TX_PC_MAR_010800_0080(0),"...What? Oh, come now. You're more beautiful 
than any of us.",

TX_PC_MAR_010800_0120(0),"I'd like that very much, H'aanit.",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0000(0),"Hey, H'aanit.",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0010(0),"Hunting ain't an easy life, is it?",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0020(0),"I am still but a prentice, and not a hunter true.",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0030(0),Tell me. Is your master a good man? Mine is.,
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0040(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0050(0),"Well, he's not my ""master,"" per se. Just 
someone I look up to more than anyone.",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0060(0),"I haven't met him in years. Still, if I knew he was 
in danger, even vicious fiends couldn't stop me 
from rushin' to his aid.",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0070(0),"...Sorry. I'm just sayin', I think I know how you 
feel, is all.",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0080(0),"Anyway, just remember I'm here to fix up any 
wounds you suffer on the way.",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0090(0),"So you don't have to hold anythin' back in your 
quest to save him!",
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0100(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0110(0),Hm? What's the matter?,
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0120(0),I was merely waiting for my turn to speaken.,
TX_PC_MAR_010900_0130(0),"And now that it has come, allow me to thanken 
thee...from the bottom of mine heart.",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0000(0),"Linde is popular with children, isn't she?",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0010(0),"Yes. In our village, the younglings oft playede 
with her.",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0020(0),"Linde seemed to enjoyen the games, as well.",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0030(0),"Nothing warms the heart quite like seeing 
children smile.",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0040(0),"Linde is most proud of her fur. She liketh 
nothing better than to be stroked and groomed.",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0050(0),I can see that.,
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0060(0),"Of course, the children liken it also, to buryen 
themselves in her thick, warm coat.",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0080(0),Erm...,
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0090(0),Yes? What is it?,
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0100(0),"Do you think Linde would snap at me if <span style=""italic"">I</> 
stroked her?",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0110(0),Of course not. Wilt thou?,
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0120(0),"Would I ever! Once the children have had their 
turn, of course.",
TX_PC_MAR_020000_0130(0),Then by all means...,
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0000(0),"So what's the plan? Something tells me a simple 
""pretty please"" isn't going to work.",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0010(0),"Truth be told, I doe not knowe.",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0020(0),"I wonder if the stubborn oaf has any 
weaknesses.",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0030(0),Weaknesses?,
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0040(0),"We all have them, after all.",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0050(0),"Even thou, Therion?",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0060(0),Huh? Since when are we talking about me?,
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0070(0),Aha! So thou dost.,
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0080(0),"If you're going to be like this, you can forget 
about my help.",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0090(0),"Mine apologies. We were discussing the 
bodyguard.",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0100(0),"Hard as it may be to believe, I've known my 
share of big, burly types who were spooked by 
beasts...",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0110(0),"Beasts, thou sayest?",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0120(0),"No promises that this one's the same, of 
course. But it's worth a try, wouldn't you say?",
TX_PC_MAR_020100_0130(0),'Tis curious advice...but I shalle consideren it.,
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0000(0),"Why, and I thought herb-of-grace was gone 
from this world!",
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0010(0),"Even botanists believed the plant was long 
extinct.",
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0020(0),"To think it still grows in these wintry wastes. 
'Tis a miracle, or near enough.",
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0030(0),"Yes, this is why a true scholar should not 
confine himself to his office! Who knows what 
great discoveries await in far-flung frontiers.",
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0040(0),"...It pleaseth me that thou findest joy in this 
quest.",
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0050(0),"And yet, that Susanna woman...",
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0060(0),What of her?,
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0070(0),"Well, I was just most impressed to encounter 
one so wise and astute.",
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0080(0),"(And her name... It sounds familiar, somehow.)",
TX_PC_MAR_020400_0090(0),"(I must review my tomes when this journey is 
over.)",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0000(0),"Wow! Would you look at that!? Snow and ice, as 
far as the eye can see!",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0010(0),"It's beautiful, don't you think?",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0020(0),It is indeed.,
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0030(0),"I have roamed far and wide on the hunt, but 
never beheld a place such as this.",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0040(0),"The snow's like a silk wedding gown, but even 
softer and whiter. And more beautiful.",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0050(0),A silk gown...?,
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0060(0),"Tell me, Tressa. Couldst thou placen a price on 
this scene?",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0070(0),"Hehe. Of course not, silly.",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0080(0),"As much as I'd like to take it home with me, a 
sight like this can't be bought.",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0090(0),"There's not enough room in anyone's bag for a 
treasure like this!",
TX_PC_MAR_020500_0100(0),Indeed. I daresaye thou art right.,
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0000(0),So...a dragon.,
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0010(0),"As a boy, I heard many a tale of dragons and 
the valiant knights who vanquished them.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0020(0),"And yet I thought the age of dragons was long 
past. Never did I imagine I would set eyes upon 
such a beast.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0030(0),"Master sayeth he once huntede a dragon...if only 
the once.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0040(0),"Now that is a tale I would very much like to 
hear.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0050(0),"If that is thy wish. But knowest thou that 
Master's stories growen more fanciful with 
every telling.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0060(0),"He suddenly recalleth that the dragon can speak. 
Or weaveth dreadful magic...",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0070(0),"Or burneth a company of knights with one 
breath. Or smasheth castle walls with a single 
fell blow...",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0080(0),"...Yet still. He doth bearen scars on his back 
from the dragon's claws.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0090(0),"They at least aren true, if little else of his tale is.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0100(0),"I see. Then you and he have accomplished the 
same mighty deed.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0110(0),"Yes. Though he hath many faults, I cannot 
denyen he is a great hunter.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0120(0),"But now, it is as if I have stepped out of his long 
shadow, to standen alone in the sun.",
TX_PC_MAR_0207A0_0130(0),"You have lofty goals, I can see that—but you 
are one step closer to them now.",
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0000(0),"Hehe, how charming...",
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0010(0),"...What art thou sniggering about, Primrose?",
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0020(0),That Alaic fellow. He surely fancies you.,
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0030(0),What!? Thou speakest nonsense.,
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0040(0),"He treateth me as Susanna bade him. As a guest 
of her home.",
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0050(0),"Oh, trust me. I know men. The way he acted 
toward you...",
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0060(0),"It wasn't anything like the way he acted toward 
the rest of us.",
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0070(0),B-but...,
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0080(0),"Oh bless, look at you blush. Tell me, H'aanit, what

TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0090(0),"I, er...don't—that is, uhm...",
TX_PC_MAR_A207A0_0100(0),Someone strong. Stronger than me...,

TX_PC_MAR_020800_0010(0),"What is it, Alfyn?",
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0020(0),"Oh, nothin'. Just admirin' the compoundin' in this 
potion.",
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0030(0),"The old lady knows how to brew 'em, that's for 
sure.",
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0040(0),"How dost thou judgen a medicine to be good or 
bad?",
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0050(0),"Oh, that's easy.",
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0060(0),It's right here.,
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0070(0),...?,
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0080(0),Why art thou poking me in the chest?,
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0090(0),"Because I'm makin' a point. The answer's in here. 
Get it?",
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0100(0),A good medicine has heart and soul.,
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0110(0),"The heart and soul of the one that made it—and 
that old lady has oodles of both.",
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0120(0),...I see.,
TX_PC_MAR_020800_0130(0),"Thou couldst have just said that, without the 
poking.",
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0000(0),W-we made it... Water... I need water!,
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0010(0),This heat...is killing me...!,
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0020(0),"But I guess...this is all my fault. I should've 
stocked up on water...",
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0030(0),'Tis not that bad. Stayen thy whimpering.,
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0040(0),"It's just...I'm not used to this. I'm a merchant, not 
a strong hunter like you.",
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0050(0),Hearest thou Linde complainen?,
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0060(0),I'm not a giant leopard either...,
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0080(0),"There, there, Tressa. Thou art a good girl. It will 
ben all right.",
TX_PC_MAR_030000_0090(0),Er...meow?,
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0000(0),"So this is Marsalim. Yes...yes, it is just as I 
expected.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0010(0),Knowest thou this town?,
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0020(0),"Why, but of course!",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0030(0),"That said, I know more about the Marsalim of 
old than I do the city as it exists today.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0040(0),"The ruler of this town can trace his lineage 
directly back to Marsalim the Wise.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0050(0),"An ancient king, I presume?",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0060(0),"Quite so. War has long ravaged the Sunlands. 
Water is more precious than lifeblood here.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0070(0),"...And men are more than willing to slay each 
other for a few precious drops.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0080(0),Yet the town appeareth calm and peaceful.,
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0090(0),"You can thank the current king for that. It was 
he who brokered peace and finally brought the 
war to an end.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0100(0),"He urged the warlords and nobles to lay down 
their weapons and simply <span style=""italic"">talk</> to their neighbors.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0110(0),"...And they found they had more in common 
than they had thought?",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0120(0),"Precisely so. In their gratitude, the people of the 
Sunlands built the king a grand palace.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0130(0),"The Jade Palace, a home fit for the wisest of 
kings.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0140(0),"It was a name chosen not by the king, but by 
the people.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30000_0150(0),"A palace built by the people, and named by them, 
too? Quite forward-thinking for such an ancient 
civilization.",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0000(0),"According to Eliza, the king's soldiers are bound 
for the dungeon where Redeye is lurking.",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0010(0),I pray they are not marching to their doom...,
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0020(0),"I doe not doubten they haven a plan... But yes, I 
feare for them also.",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0030(0),"Yes, this Redeye is such a horrific, terrible fiend.",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0040(0),"In times such as this, what sort of prayers dost 
thou offeren?",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0050(0),"Please teachen me, so that I mighte prayen, too....",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0060(0),"Of course. Here's a simple one. Just repeat after 
me...",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0070(0),May the Flame protect these brave men.,
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0080(0),"Erm... May the Flame protecteth these brave 
men.",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0090(0),...Like that?,
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0100(0),"Yes, perfect.",
TX_PC_MAR_0301D0_0110(0),"I thanke thee. I, too, shalle prayen for their safe 
return.",
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0010(0),Thou lookest deep in thought.,
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0020(0),"...My apologies. Seeing that king, it reminded me 
of days gone by.",
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0030(0),"He has the same look about him as King Alfred, 
the last king of Hornburg.",
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0040(0),...What manner of look is that?,
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0050(0),"That of a man who looks you straight in the 
eye, and speaks the plain and honest truth.",
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0060(0),"A man who believes in himself and the words 
he speaks.",
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0070(0),"And because he believes in them, others can, 
too, without fear of betrayal.",
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0080(0),...I see.,
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0090(0),"I, too, hadde the same feeling about that king.",
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0100(0),"That is good to hear. Then you need worry 
about nothing but your quest.",
TX_PC_MAR_030400_0110(0),...Indeed. Thanke thee.,
TX_PC_MAR_A30400_0000(0),"""Betrayst not the trust of others,"" eh?",
TX_PC_MAR_A30400_0010(0),"First and foremost, I hunte Redeye to saven my

My honor as a hunter demandeth it.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30400_0040(0),"When I set my sights on my quarry, I'm as

TX_PC_MAR_A30400_0050(0),Thou speakest of thievery.,
TX_PC_MAR_A30400_0060(0),"Heh. Doesn't sit right with you, eh? To think 
we're more alike than different.",
TX_PC_MAR_A30400_0070(0),"If thou choosest to taken pride in thy work, I

TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0060(0),"...Just so. And when this is over, I shalle buyen 
thee a mug of thy favorite spirit.",
TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0070(0),"When your master's up and about, we'll all drink 
together!",
TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0080(0),Master wolde liken that...far too much.,
TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0090(0),"It's settled then! First save your master, then 
we'll hit the alehouse.",
TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0100(0),"After all you two've been through, a reunion 
has got to be celebrated. Am I right?",
TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0110(0),Thou speakest truly. But Alfyn...,
TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0120(0),Yeah?,
TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0130(0),"He will not caren about the reason, only that 
spirits be served.",
TX_PC_MAR_A305A0_0140(0),"Haha, a man after my own heart! Now let's go 
thaw out that master of yours!",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0000(0),"So, Therion. Do you really think we'll find the 
dragonstone here?",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0010(0),"That's the question of the day, isn't it? Won't 
know until we ask around.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0020(0),"I suppose for you, that means hanging out in 
the alehouse, eavesdropping for rumors and 
the like...",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0030(0),"If you ask me, I think it's better to just talk to 
people. You're more likely to get an honest 
answer that way.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0040(0),"In my line of work, you can't afford to chase 
after every wild rumor you hear. You have to 
find people you can trust.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0050(0),"...Eh. Visit enough alehouses, and you learn to 
separate the wheat from the chaff.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0060(0),"And in <span style=""italic"">my</> line of work, it's not wise to make 
too many friends. They tend not to last.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0070(0),...I see.,
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0080(0),"I guess that means we're both cut out for our 
own trades.",
TX_PC_GIL_010000_0090(0),Heh... I guess you could say that.,
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0000(0),"Tell me. How would <span style=""italic"">you</> get into this building?",
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0010(0),An interesting query...,
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0020(0),"Were it a battlefield, I would seek out the 
weakest flank and strike, using the element of 
surprise.",
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0030(0),"Oh? Would've figured you more for a full frontal 
assault.",
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0040(0),"Of course I would consider that, too, were it 
necessary.",
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0050(0),"But either way, reaching the center of the 
manse would be no easy task.",
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0060(0),"Brute force can only get you so far, eh?",
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0070(0),"Just so. The straight way of the soldier is not 
always the surest, nor quickest, path.",
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0080(0),"Hence, this venture is best left in your hands. I'm 
most eager to see your skills in action.",
TX_PC_GIL_010100_0090(0),Heh. Never thought I'd have an audience...,
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0000(0),"...Not a bad crowd, if I say so myself.",
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0010(0),...Hm?,
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0020(0),"Of course, the tavern where I used to ply my 
trade was far livelier.",
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0030(0),"It's hard to rouse the crowd without a 
little...entertainment, after all.",
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0040(0),"The quiet works for me. Especially when I need 
to talk shop.",
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0050(0),Is that so...?,
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0060(0),"Still, I might as well perform one dance and lift 
the people's spirits...",
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0080(0),Hey! Where do you think you're going!?,
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0090(0),...We need to keep a low profile.,
TX_PC_GIL_010200_0100(0),...Hmph. Can't a girl have a little fun?,
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0000(0),"So. How dost thou proposen to getten water 
from that merchant?",
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0010(0),"Do you have to ask? You know what I do for a 
living.",
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0020(0),Thievery.,
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0030(0),"Don't approve, do you?",
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0040(0),"To speake truly, I doe not.",
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0050(0),...Fair enough.,
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0060(0),It's no secret. What I do isn't exactly noble.,
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0070(0),"Thou needest not defenden thyself. We aren 
comrades. I can putte my personal prejudices 
aside.",
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0080(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0090(0),"Comrades, eh?",
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0100(0),Did I saye something odd?,
TX_PC_GIL_0103A0_0110(0),No. Never mind...,
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0000(0),"Stealin' here, stealin' there, stealin' pretty much 
everywhere...",
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0010(0),"Heck, you thieves sure do work hard!",
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0030(0),"And you're one of the best, right? You gotta 
have a massive stash of treasure hidden away.",
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0040(0),Let's just say I'm prepared for retirement.,
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0050(0),I...I see.,
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0060(0),"Anyway, one more task and our job's done! 
Light at the end of the tunnel, eh?",
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0070(0),"""Our""? It's not like <span style=""italic"">you're</> doing any thieving.",
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0080(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0090(0),"(Man, talk about a tough crowd...)",
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0100(0),"Anyway, when the job's done, what say we go 
hit the tavern?",
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0110(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_0104A0_0120(0),Sure. One mug...your treat.,
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0000(0),"I swear, scholars have to be the most 
pigheaded folk around.",
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0010(0),"There's some truth to... No, I'm afraid I must 
protest.",
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0020(0),"You must understand that not all scholars are 
like the master here.",
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0030(0),"I concede there are stubborn types obsessed 
with their research and blind to all else...",
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0040(0),"But there are broad-minded thinkers, too, who 
freely seek wisdom and truth in all its forms. 
Like myself, for example.",
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0050(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0060(0),...I see. Let me rephrase myself.,
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0070(0),"By all means, my friend!",
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0080(0),"Scholars are some of the most pompous and 
pedantic people I've ever had the joy of meeting.",
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0090(0),"Now that's hardly an improvement! Allow me to 
make a counter-argument...",
TX_PC_GIL_0107B0_0100(0),Case in point. Now if you'll excuse me...,
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0000(0),"So that is a dragonstone. Why, it's so beautiful...",
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0010(0),"...Huh. Wouldn't have thought you religious types 
had much interest in gems.",
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0020(0),"I care not for material wealth, if that is what 
you mean. But I can sense a strange power in 
those stones.",
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0030(0),"I'll have to take your word on that. It's not 
exactly my area of expertise.",
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0040(0),"But whatever the reason, it's not a bad thing for 
someone like you to be interested in pretty 
gems.",
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0050(0),Whatever do you mean by that?,
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0060(0),"I mean, most girls your age like to wear 
brooches and bangles, right?",
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0070(0),"If you ask me, a better place for these gems 
would be on the wrist of a young lady like 
yourself.",
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0080(0),Wh-why...,
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0090(0),"Now you're just teasing me, aren't you? Well, I 
think this conversation is over!",
TX_PC_GIL_0108A0_0100(0),...Heh.,
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0010(0),...What is it?,
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0020(0),"When I see thee talken with such a glib tongue...I 
must confesse to some envy.",
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0030(0),"It's a skill to be learned, like any other. One that's 
useful in my trade.",
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0040(0),"Ah, but is the learning so easy? I meane, if it is 
not in thy nature to begin with.",
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0050(0),"I have always felt clumsy of tongue. Not like my 
master, nor my friends back home...",
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0060(0),Then practice. No better time to start than now.,
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0070(0),...Now?,
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0080(0),"Yeah. Just loosen your tongue. Say what's on 
your mind.",
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0090(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0100(0),"W-well, then... Yes, I...ah...I muste declare... Bah! 
Why is this so difficult?",
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0110(0),...Heh.,
TX_PC_GIL_0200A0_0120(0),"'Tis thy fault, abruptly ordering me to talken! 
And stoppen grinning like a fool!",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0000(0),"A black market! I bet it's filled with all kinds 
of...<span style=""italic"">questionable</> treasures.",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0010(0),"Oh, that reminds me! I picked up this treasure 
the other day...",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0020(0),Hah! Your ears perked up just now!,
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0030(0),...How observant of you. Now go on.,
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0040(0),"Well, you won't believe this, but...",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0050(0),...I found myself a gigaswallow egg!,
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0060(0),"Gigaswallows are very rare, and build their 
nests in dangerous, remote places.",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0070(0),"And gigaswallow egg soup is one of Orsterra's 
greatest delicacies!",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0080(0),"Anyway, a loyal customer gave me the egg as a 
gift.",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0090(0),"When he handed it to me, my hands were 
shaking with excitement. I'm still surprised I 
didn't drop it!",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0100(0),...Hmm. I give it five out of ten.,
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0110(0),"<span style=""italic"">Five!?</> All right then, Mr. Know-it-All, what do 
<span style=""italic"">you</> have that's so wonderful?",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0120(0),"You want to know about my shady dealings? 
Sure, if you don't mind becoming an accomplice...",
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0130(0),...!,
TX_PC_GIL_A200A0_0140(0),"(I guess this is why they say, ""curiosity killed 
the cait""...)",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0010(0),"Something eating at you, Professor? You're 
looking all furrow-browed today.",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0020(0),"Truth be told, I do not care much for black 
markets.",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0030(0),"It's just a place for trading goods, like any other.",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0040(0),"Ah, but the goods that flow through it pass 
from darkness to darkness, unseen by lawful 
men.",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0050(0),"What wonders, what priceless relics, have been 
lost to the greater populace because of these 
shadowy deals?",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0060(0),"Relics such as those dragonstones you're 
chasing after, for example.",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0070(0),"It's not my job to question. When I need 
something, I go steal it. Simple as that.",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0080(0),"Gracious, you do not even try to soften the 
truth. It is almost...admirable.",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0090(0),"Look. You use your mind to make your way in 
the world. I use my fingers.",
TX_PC_GIL_020100_0100(0),"Indeed. I suppose, then, we are both suited to 
our respective pursuits...",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0000(0),"Tell me, Master Thief. How do you plan on 
getting in?",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0010(0),"Truth be told, I haven't decided yet.",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0020(0),Oh really?,
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0030(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0040(0),"Look, I'm trying to concentrate here.",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0050(0),"Oh, sorry. Am I bothering you?",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0060(0),...You're in an awfully good mood today.,
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0070(0),"Well, I <span style=""italic"">am</> rather excited, after all.",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0080(0),"Joining a real, live thief on one of his 
capers—it's like mystery theater come to life.",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0090(0),"Well, it's not a show. It's serious business.",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0100(0),"Oh, of course. That's why I'm going to be a 
good girl and leave you to it.",
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0110(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_020200_0120(0),"(It <span style=""italic"">is</> very exciting, though...)",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0000(0),"Aw, shucks... We're fallin' behind!",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0010(0),"C'mon, Therion! I've got your back.",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0020(0),"...Not so fast, medicine man. I'm not looking for 
company.",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0030(0),"Stubborn as ever, I see...",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0040(0),"Look. If you get hurt, who's goin' to mix you a 
salve? Huh?",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0050(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0060(0),"Got a wound? Call for an apothecary. Need 
somethin' stolen? Summon a thief.",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0070(0),"We've all got our role to play, right?",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0080(0),...If you say so.,
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0090(0),"Then let's go, and when we're done, I'll buy the 
first round!",
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0100(0),...Don't even think about it.,
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0110(0),Huh?,
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0120(0),First round's on me.,
TX_PC_GIL_020400_0130(0),"Well shucks, if you insist! And now I <span style=""italic"">really</> 
wanna hurry!",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0000(0),"Aw, shucks... We're fallin' behind!",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0010(0),"C'mon, Therion! I've got your back.",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0020(0),"...Not so fast, medicine man. I'm not looking for 
company.",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0030(0),"Stubborn as ever, I see...",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0040(0),"Look. If you get hurt, who's goin' to mix you a 
salve? Huh?",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0050(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0060(0),"Got a wound? Call for an apothecary. Need 
somethin' stolen? Ask for a thief.",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0070(0),"We've all got our role to play, right?",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0080(0),...If you say so.,
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0090(0),"Then let's go, and when we're done, I'll buy the 
first round!",
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0100(0),...Don't even think about it.,
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0110(0),Huh?,
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0120(0),First round's on me.,
TX_PC_GIL_0204A0_0130(0),"Well shucks, if you insist! And now I <span style=""italic"">really</> 
wanna hurry!",
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0000(0),Erm...Therion?,
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0010(0),That's my name.,
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0020(0),Is something the matter?,
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0030(0),"No. Nothing that concerns you, at least.",
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0040(0),"It's just that your expression is so 
uncharacteristically grim.",
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0050(0),"You seem awfully interested in the state of my 
face. Is it that fascinating?",
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0060(0),"It's not about your face, nor my interest in it. 
You're in a mood, and I simply want to know 
why!",
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0070(0),...I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.,
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0080(0),"It's all right. But like I said, don't worry about it.",
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0090(0),"After all, a frown suits you even less than it 
suits me.",
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0100(0),"W-well... In that case, I shall say no more.",
TX_PC_GIL_020600_0110(0),"(Good...because it really isn't important. And it's 
my problem alone...)",
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0000(0),"Who is this man Darius, anyhow?",
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0010(0),...And why should I tell you that?,
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0030(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0040(0),"No particular reason. After all, it's not as if we 
are confederates.",
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0050(0),Then let's get on with this.,
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0060(0),"But if there <span style=""italic"">is</> anything you need to say...",
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0070(0),...Hm?,
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0080(0),"Just remember you need not bear your 
burdens alone. There are people ready to lend 
you their strength.",
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0090(0),"We may not be confederates, but we can help 
each other.",
TX_PC_GIL_020700_0100(0),...Heh. We'll see about that.,
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0000(0),"So now you're a wanted man...eh, Therion?",
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0010(0),Yeah. As if I didn't have enough problems.,
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0020(0),But think about it...,
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0030(0),"Those wanted posters show that you've got 
Darius runnin' scared.",
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0040(0),"And that proves you're a thief to be reckoned 
with. Right?",
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0050(0),"...Fair enough. Maybe you're good for more 
than mixing potions after all.",
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0060(0),"Ahaha! That's me, full of surprises.",
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0070(0),"So let's go, Therion. If anything happens, I've got 
your back.",
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0080(0),"...Heh. No offense, but I hope I won't be needing 
your services.",
TX_PC_GIL_0300A0_0090(0),Now that's the spirit! Let's go.,
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0000(0),"You sure like your alehouses—don't you, 
Therion?",
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0010(0),"I don't go because I ""like"" them. I go to hear 
people talk.",
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0020(0),Mead and spirits are good for loosening tongues.,
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0030(0),"Heh, so your interest is purely professional.",
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0040(0),"Look, taverns are places where rumors and 
secrets are spoken and traded. But I wouldn't 
expect a brat like you to understand.",
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0050(0),Hey! Who are you calling a brat?,
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0060(0),"I've been turning trades and making profits since 
I was five!",
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0070(0),Have you now?,
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0080(0),"I delivered spirits to three alehouses every day 
for over a year.",
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0090(0),I've seen my share of drunken fools.,
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0100(0),Should I be impressed?,
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0110(0),"You bet! Still can't stand the smell of grog, 
though. Makes me gag.",
TX_PC_GIL_A300A0_0120(0),"...Still a brat after all, then.",
TX_PC_GIL_030300_0000(0),...Yeah? You look like you want to say something.,
TX_PC_GIL_030300_0010(0),"From the expression on your face, it would 
seem you've found your answer.",
TX_PC_GIL_030300_0020(0),My answer?,
TX_PC_GIL_030300_0030(0),...Hm. Maybe I have.,
TX_PC_GIL_030300_0040(0),"It is a good thing, to set one's mind at ease.",
TX_PC_GIL_030300_0050(0),"Is it not invigorating, to allow yourself to trust 
another?",
TX_PC_GIL_030300_0060(0),...Maybe it is.,
TX_PC_GIL_030300_0070(0),"I guess it's never too late to learn something 
new.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0000(0),Therion. You have borne a heavy burden...,
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0010(0),It is what it is.,
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0020(0),"But I know holding grudges against others won't 
change the past, or right my wrongs.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0030(0),"There's no point crying over yesterday. It's 
what I do today and tomorrow that counts.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0040(0),So spare me your sermons...and your sympathy.,
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0050(0),"I would not presume to offer either. All I meant 
to say, is that...",
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0060(0),"Despite your circumstances, you resent no man 
in this world.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0070(0),"That is no common thing, for resentment abides 
in nearly all our hearts.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0080(0),Never thought of it that way.,
TX_PC_GIL_A30300_0090(0),"Just never saw much point in holding grudges. 
Simple as that.",
TX_PC_GIL_0304D0_0000(0),"In nature, there existeth many kinds of mimics.",
TX_PC_GIL_0304D0_0010(0),Yeah? Like what?,
TX_PC_GIL_0304D0_0020(0),"Well, there is a lizard that pretendeth to be a

TX_PC_GIL_0304D0_0070(0),"'Tis most interesting to me, to see what role

TX_PC_GIL_0304D0_0080(0),Great. I'll try to keep you entertained.,

TX_PC_GIL_0304F0_0100(0),...Don't push your luck.,
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0000(0),"For an organization, they are really 
most...disorganized.",
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0010(0),"If it makes my job easier, I'll take it.",
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0020(0),I figured you'd say something like that.,
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0030(0),"Still, their de facto leader barely exerts any 
control over the rank and file.",
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0040(0),"And you'd expect otherwise? They're just a 
band of thieves.",
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0050(0),"I would posit that there is more to it than just 
that.",
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0060(0),"For this Darius, the men of his organization are 
little more than tools...",
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0070(0),"He does not consider them comrades, let alone 
friends. I daresay he trusts no one but himself.",
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0080(0),...You may be right.,
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0090(0),"At any rate, your goal is close at hand, Therion. 
Do not waver in your convictions.",
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0100(0),...Heh. You can count on me.,
TX_PC_GIL_030500_0110(0),(...I hope.),
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0000(0),Another star turn by our master thief.,
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0010(0),Huh?,
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0020(0),"I could scarcely tell it was you. You simply 
disappeared into that role.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0030(0),"You could have a stellar career in the theater, if 
you chose to pursue it.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0040(0),...Heh.,
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0050(0),"Thanks, but no thanks. I take on roles when my 
work demands it...that's all.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0060(0),"A shame, that.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0070(0),"Stars of the stage earn more money in one 
night than most thieves do in a year.",
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0080(0),...,
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0090(0),"But of course, if you're not interested...",
TX_PC_GIL_A30500_0100(0),"...On second thought, I think I'll keep my options 
open.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0000(0),"You can find lots of rare plants and herbs in 
these lands.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0010(0),"Especially lion's ear and sweet wormwood—a 
dash of each makes nearly every salve better.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0020(0),"When I was studyin' to be an apothecary, I 
sometimes journeyed out here in search of 
ingredients.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0030(0),Is that so?,
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0040(0),"Here, look at this one. White skullcap, they call it.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0050(0),"The petals are good for fevers. I grind them 
with root starch and honey...",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0060(0),"Oh, it's wonderful!",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0070(0),"Ain't it? It was one of the first medicines I 
learned.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0080(0),"I mean, I've never seen such a beautiful flower!",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0090(0),"I s'ppose it <span style=""italic"">is</> pretty to look at. Here, you can 
have this one if you like.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0100(0),"Why, Alfyn. You are too kind.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0110(0),"Shucks. If you like flowers that much, I can pick 
plenty more for you.",
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0120(0),I'd like that.,
TX_PC_ULR_0101B0_0130(0),"(Gosh, she's a cute little lady...)",
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0010(0),"What's the matter, Professor? You look agitated.",
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0020(0),"I never thought the day would come when I'd 
witness the Kindling with my own eyes.",
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0030(0),"I keep telling myself to not get overly 
excited—but frankly, I just can't help myself!",
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0040(0),So you've heard tell of the Kindling before?,
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0050(0),But of course!,
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0060(0),"It is one of the central rites of the church, held 
every twenty years.",
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0070(0),"The embers borne from Flamesgrace feed the 
sacred fires across the land.",
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0080(0),"Many people know of the Kindling, but few have 
the opportunity to witness it first hand.",
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0090(0),It shall be the experience of a lifetime!,
TX_PC_ULR_A101B0_0100(0),"Well, then. Now I have another reason to see 
this through to the end.",
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0000(0),"So that brooch was an heirloom from the 
child's mother.",
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0010(0),That's right.,
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0020(0),"Let me help, Ophilia. Between the two of us, 
we're sure to find it.",
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0030(0),"Thank you, Primrose!",
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0040(0),I'll start looking over here.,
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0050(0),"Erm, are you sure you want to rummage 
through the undergrowth in those clothes?",
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0060(0),Why? Is something wrong with them?,
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0070(0),"(What do I do? Her legs are quite exposed in 
those garments...)",
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0080(0),(But I don't know if I can say such a thing...),
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0090(0),"You're as red as a beet, Ophilia. If nothing's 
wrong with my clothing, could we get back to 
the matter at hand?",
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0100(0),"The sooner we find the brooch, the sooner 
those children can be friends again.",
TX_PC_ULR_010300_0110(0),R-right!,
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0000(0),Hmmm...,
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0010(0),"Is something the matter, Tressa?",
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0020(0),"I'm just thinking about Derryl. He seems so 
spoiled, even for a kid!",
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0030(0),"...You know what? I think I'll go and give him a 
piece of my mind!",
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0040(0),"No, Tressa! You can't do that!",
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0050(0),"The poor child has been through so much. 
Lecturing him now will just make things worse.",
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0060(0),"I know what I'm doing, Ophilia. I'll even take 
some candy with me!",
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0070(0),Candy...?,
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0080(0),"Oh! To cheer him up, you mean?",
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0090(0),"Cheer him up...? Why would I want to do that? I 
just thought I'd bribe him to be on his best 
behavior with it, if all else failed!",
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0100(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_010400_0110(0),"...You know, Tressa, perhaps it's best that I 
handle it.",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0000(0),A dog with a brooch in its jaws? That could be it.,
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0010(0),"When dogs catchen prey they aren too full to 
eat, they oft buryen it for safekeeping.",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0020(0),"They aren collectors, and hiden away sticks, 
toys, and old bones, too.",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0030(0),"So you think the dog may have buried Derryl's 
heirloom?",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0040(0),"The dog meant no malice. It actede solely upon 
instinct.",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0050(0),"The problem is the forest. It is home not just to 
animals, but dangerous monsters, too.",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0060(0),"As a hunter, I feare them more.",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0070(0),"As do I, to be honest.",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0080(0),I pray that Derryl and Emil are unharmed...,
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0090(0),"I shalt leave the praying to thee. But for now, 
leten us keepen moving.",
TX_PC_ULR_010600_0100(0),Definitely!,
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0010(0),"You're very quiet, Therion.",
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0030(0),"Are you thinking how heartwarming it is, to see 
quarreling friends make good again?",
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0040(0),"...Not exactly. They just reminded me of 
something.",
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0050(0),And what might that be?,
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0060(0),"My childhood. It wasn't particularly a happy one, 
though, so you're probably better off not 
hearing the details.",
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0070(0),"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry...",
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0080(0),No need to apologize. It was a long time ago.,
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0090(0),"It's nothing but a memory now. And I know I'm 
not the only one around with such an <span style=""italic"">uplifting</> 
past.",
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0100(0),"I admire your attitude, Therion. It's very brave.",
TX_PC_ULR_0108A0_0110(0),...Hardly. It's nothing to write home about.,
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0000(0),"Children can take you by surprise. We oft forget 
what they are capable of.",
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0010(0),"Hehe. It sounds like you are speaking from 
personal experience.",
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0020(0),"...There's a young lad back in my village. I was 
teaching him the sword.",
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0030(0),Are you worried for him?,
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0040(0),...Nay.,
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0050(0),"'Twould be a lie to say I do not think of him 
from time to time—but I do not worry.",
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0060(0),"I taught him what I could of the sword, and 
other things besides.",
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0070(0),He took the lessons well. I have faith in the lad.,
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0080(0),...I cannot tell you how happy that makes me.,
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0090(0),How so?,
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0100(0),"Well, it's a belief of mine...",
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0110(0),"That every child should have a mentor, to take 
them in hand and show them what is right and 
wrong.",
TX_PC_ULR_0109A0_0120(0),And I concur.,
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0000(0),"I wolde know more of this man, to whom thou 
spokest earlier.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0010(0),"You mean Master Mattias? He is a merchant I 
met in Flamesgrace.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0020(0),"He was of great help to me when I was 
preparing for my journey.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0030(0),"So it was a fortunate happenstance to meeten 
him again here.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0040(0),"It certainly was. I'm starting to think that 
Fortune is smiling favorably on this quest.",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0050(0),"I met you, after all. If that's not good fortune, I 
don't know what is!",
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0060(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0070(0),Is something the matter?,
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0080(0),Nothing. 'Tis nothing at all.,
TX_PC_ULR_020000_0090(0),"Are you sure? Your face suddenly turned bright 
red.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0000(0),I wonder where that child could have gone...,
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0010(0),Something troubling you?,
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0020(0),"Ah, Professor. Well, the truth is...",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0030(0),"...I see. So there was a child spying on you 
earlier.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0040(0),"Yes. But when I spotted him, he ran off to the 
gods only know where.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0050(0),"He looked to be in trouble. I'm sure I could help, 
if only I could find him again.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0060(0),"Truly, you are a kind soul. It would well 
behoove me to assist you in this charitable 
quest.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0070(0),"Why, thank you.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0080(0),"Whenever you strive to help others, people 
become inspired to help you. I am no exception.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0090(0),"Now, about this runaway. I don't imagine he 
could have gone far...",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0100(0),"So I think it best that we thoroughly search the 
vicinity rather than rushing about and spreading 
ourselves too thin.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0110(0),"Haste does make waste, after all.",
TX_PC_ULR_020100_0120(0),"You always have the best advice, Professor.",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0000(0),That priest is definitely hiding something.,
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0010(0),"He certainly seemed...distracted, didn't he?",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0020(0),"Well, there's the understatement of the year. I 
don't think he heard a word you said. He was 
clearly worried about something.",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0030(0),He's an open book.,
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0040(0),"Well, he is not a man who's accustomed to lying 
or prevaricating.",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0050(0),That much is obvious.,
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0060(0),"But I'm worried for him. What could be troubling 
him so?",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0070(0),"Maybe you're being set up—and he's in on the 
game.",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0080(0),"If that is true, then there must be something 
forcing his hand.",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0090(0),"If we can get to the bottom of what is 
worrying him, we might be able to help.",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0100(0),...You have a little too much faith in people.,
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0110(0),Do you think so?,
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0120(0),"I can hardly imagine him wishing harm on 
anyone, least of all us.",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0130(0),"We should learn more before we start making 
assumptions.",
TX_PC_ULR_020200_0140(0),"If you insist. I just hope your good intentions 
don't go bad...",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0000(0),"Hey, Ophilia. I owe you a thanks.",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0010(0),You do?,
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0020(0),It was just like you said.,
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0030(0),"It ain't right for a father to turn his back on his 
child.",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0040(0),"And when I see someone usin' kids for their 
own end, it makes my blood boil.",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0050(0),"I feel the same, Alfyn.",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0060(0),But the truth is...I'm a little afraid.,
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0070(0),"Aw, shucks, Ophilia. We're pals now.",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0080(0),"Me and my medicine are gonna be right here at 
your side.",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0090(0),"So you've got nothin' in the world to worry 
about, all right?",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0100(0),"Thank you, Alfyn. It gives me strength, knowing 
that you stand with me.",
TX_PC_ULR_0203B0_0110(0),"(Strength...and peace of mind, too. I wonder if 
this is what it's like to have an older brother.)",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0010(0),"Is something troubling you, Primrose?",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0020(0),I can't wrap my head around it...,
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0030(0),"Having faith so strong that you'd give up your 
own life for it.",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0040(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0050(0),"See, I prefer to put my faith in myself.",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0060(0),"When I feel helpless, or find myself in trouble...",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0070(0),"I continue to believe in myself, no matter the 
situation.",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0080(0),"Fine words. Believing in yourself is important, 
and powerful...",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0090(0),"But you'll still let me help you, won't you? At 
least some of the time?",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0100(0),"Because come what may, I am your friend and 
ally.",
TX_PC_ULR_020600_0110(0),Of course. And...thank you.,
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0000(0),"This Kindling Ceremony sure seems like a big 
deal in the church.",
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0010(0),Don't you get nervous?,
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0020(0),"Oh, very much so, believe me.",
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0030(0),"I can't help but imagine the worst, like forgetting 
the words to the prayer or tripping over my 
own feet...",
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0040(0),I know exactly how you feel!,
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0050(0),"I get so anxious when I restock the shop, but 
no one buys anything.",
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0060(0),"But then again, it's kind of thrilling, too. It's what 
makes trading so exciting.",
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0070(0),"Right. Challenges are what make everything 
worthwhile.",
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0080(0),"So even if I'm nervous, I know that the Kindling 
is an important ceremony, and I have to do it 
right.",
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0090(0),That's the spirit!,
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0100(0),"So shake off that nervousness and let's get 
going, Ophilia!",
TX_PC_ULR_0207C0_0110(0),"Yes, let's, Tressa.",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0000(0),"(Oh, Lianna, why?)",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0010(0),She must have had her reasons.,
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0020(0),Huh?,
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0030(0),"You are thinking about the young girl who stole 
the ember, are you not?",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0040(0),"Do you truly think her capable of committing 
such an act on her own?",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0050(0),"No! ...No, I don't.",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0060(0),"All she's ever wanted was to make the 
archbishop—her father—proud of her.",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0070(0),"Yet she stole the ember. Mayhap something 
drove her to it.",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0080(0),Yes...,
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0090(0),"First, we should track her down and put the 
question to her.",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0100(0),"Then perchance we will find out the why and 
wherefore.",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0110(0),"What made Lianna do what she did? Was her 
hand forced?",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0120(0),"Answer those questions, and you may be able 
to help her.",
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0130(0),I will do whatever you need to assist you.,
TX_PC_ULR_0209A0_0140(0),"Thank you, Sir Olberic. I may well call upon you.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0000(0),I've seen friendlier faces in prison.,
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0010(0),"I'd bet half my ill-gotten fortune that ""Savior"" is 
here somewhere.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0020(0),"I agree. They are far too wary of us for it to be 
anything else.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0030(0),"Looks like he's turned them all into true 
believers.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0040(0),"No doubt by using some underhanded means. I 
wouldn't put manipulation past him.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0050(0),Manipulation?,
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0060(0),"Tough times will wear anyone down. 
Sometimes it leaves you weak, and vulnerable.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0070(0),"Those people want to be saved. They'll even 
start believing in miracles if it'll make life easier 
for them.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0080(0),"So if you want to be a ""savior,"" it's just a matter 
of finding what those people need saving from, 
then telling them you can do it.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0090(0),"Take it from me. Most people have more faith 
than they know what to do with.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0100(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0110(0),"But don't you think there are times when people 
truly need a savior?",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0120(0),"I believe it's not wrong to reach out for 
salvation when a helping hand is offered.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0130(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0140(0),"Then I suppose we'd best make sure it's us who 
do the saving.",
TX_PC_ULR_030000_0150(0),Exactly!,
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0000(0),"Now this isn't right. Shutting up pretty girls in a 
miserable place like this.",
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0010(0),"With a savior like this, who needs enemies?",
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0020(0),"I'm sorry, Primrose. It shouldn't have come to 
this. If only I'd—",
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0030(0),"Now, now, Ophilia. No one's saying this is your 
fault.",
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0040(0),"We should be blaming the ones that took 
advantage of your kindness.",
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0050(0),But...,
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0060(0),"But nothing. Now stop blaming yourself and help 
me find a way out of here.",
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0070(0),"Y-yes, of course!",
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0080(0),(Primrose truly does have a generous heart...),
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0090(0),Hehe...,
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0100(0),"That charlatan will get his comeuppance, ten 
times over...",
TX_PC_ULR_030200_0110(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0000(0),We have to hurry and help Lianna.,
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0010(0),"Stayen now, child. We can doen but little for 
now.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0020(0),"Yes, but—",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0030(0),"To panicken is to maken mistakes. Thou shalt 
only maken the situation worse.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0040(0),If you say so...,
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0050(0),"First things first. Thou needest rest. Both for 
thy body and thy mind.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0060(0),"'Tis the same as a hunt. The hunter must be 
tranquil and alert.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0070(0),"Else the quarry will turn the tables, and the 
hunter becometh the hunted.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0080(0),We wouldn't want that.,
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0090(0),So listenen. Thou must be patient.,
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0100(0),"Our time shall come. And when it doth, we 
shalle striken together.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0110(0),"...I'm most grateful to have you on my side, 
H'aanit.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0120(0),"Now I shalle heeden mine own counsel, and 
sleepe. Waken me if thou needest me.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0130(0),All right...,
TX_PC_ULR_A30200_0140(0),"Gracious. She fell right asleep, just like that.",
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0010(0),Ophilia...,
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0020(0),"Lianna doesn't know what she's doing. She's 
been fooled by Mattias's lies.",
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0030(0),Of course I want to believe in her. But...,
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0040(0),"When times get tough, it's easier for people to 
lose sight of what's important.",
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0050(0),"They don't know what to do, they don't know 
who to turn to...",
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0060(0),"But that's what friends are for. Friends reach 
out a hand and pull them out of the chaos, and 
help them remember what really matters.",
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0080(0),"Lianna is your friend, isn't she?",
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0090(0),"Then you have to be strong for her. Reach out 
a hand, and pull her back onto the right path.",
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0100(0),"...You're right, Tressa. Thank you.",
TX_PC_ULR_030300_0110(0),"Any time! I'm always here to lend a hand when 
you need it!",
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0000(0),"It's like you said, Ophilia.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0010(0),"Dead is dead, and there's no comin' back from it.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0030(0),"I've seen plenty of folk die in my time, and I was 
powerless to help 'em.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0040(0),"No matter how hard I tried to hold on to their 
lives, they slipped through my fingers like smoke.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0050(0),It always gets me thinkin'...,
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0060(0),Why is life so damned fragile?,
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0080(0),"In the end, death comes for all of us. It's the 
price we pay for livin'.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0090(0),Not a one of us can avoid it.,
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0100(0),"But that's why we've got an obligation to do as 
much livin' as we can while the spark's still 
flickerin'.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0110(0),Well said.,
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0120(0),"So let's live this life without regrets. Right, 
Ophilia?",
TX_PC_ULR_A30300_0130(0),Right! And Alfyn...thank you.,
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0000(0),"So, it's into the cave we go. I wonder what's 
inside?",
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0010(0),"Now's not the time for archeology, Professor.",
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0020(0),Yes. Quite right. Our priority is to rescue Lianna.,
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0030(0),"However, that cave may give us an answer to 
one of the questions that face us.",
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0040(0),What question is that?,
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0050(0),Why did Mattias choose this particular village?,
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0060(0),"...Could it be that the ceremony has to be held in 
that cave?",
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0070(0),Precisely what I was thinking.,
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0080(0),"If that is the case, then the cave is extremely 
important to Mattias's plan.",
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0090(0),"But fear not. I shall do everything in my power 
to help rescue your friend.",
TX_PC_ULR_030400_0100(0),Then surely we can't fail!,
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0010(0),"Is something troubling you, Olberic?",
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0020(0),Aye. For some time now.,
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0030(0),What is it?,
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0040(0),"Ah, there's the rub. I cannot say exactly.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0050(0),"But past experience has taught me to trust this 
feeling...",
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0060(0),"More often than not, it has been followed by 
calamity or misfortune.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0070(0),Oh. I don't like the sound of that.,
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0080(0),"Forgive me. I should be helping you, not adding 
to your worries.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0090(0),"Oh, Olberic. You mustn't apologize.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0100(0),"...But this feeling of yours might have something 
to do with Lianna.",
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0110(0),Indeed. Let us make haste.,
TX_PC_ULR_A30400_0120(0),"Right! Hang in there, Lianna, we're coming!",
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0000(0),...Thou art good with children.,
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0010(0),"You think so? Can't say I've ever thought about 
it much.",
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0020(0),"Though I always liked playin' with the young 
ones back home.",
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0030(0),So thou hast experience. The best teacher.,
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0040(0),"'Tis a fine gift indeed, to bringen joy to the faces 
of children.",
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0050(0),"Shucks, I don't reckon it's much of a gift. A big 
smile's all you need. They're infectious, you 
know.",
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0060(0),...I wondere.,
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0070(0),"It's true! Come on, why don't you give it a go?",
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0080(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0090(0),L-like this...?,
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0100(0),"Ahahaha! That's how you do it! I'm feelin' better 
already!",
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0110(0),"See, if the grown-ups aren't smilin', the kids get 
worried. They'll figure somethin's up.",
TX_PC_BAL_010000_0120(0),"Verily... Thou art a wiser man than it woulde 
first appearen.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0000(0),Your skill in brewing salves is most admirable.,
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0010(0),"Well, you've got your swordplay to boast of. 
Me, I've got my medicine.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0020(0),"Just so, my friend.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0030(0),"Neither curing nor fighting is a contest as such, 
but we all hope to triumph in our own field.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0040(0),"And indeed, meeting fellows in the same trade 
can inspire a man. Make him strive a little harder.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0050(0),"At least, so it is among men of the sword.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0060(0),"I guess you've had your run-ins with rivals who 
you hated losin' to.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0070(0),...That would be all of them.,
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0080(0),"But unlike swordsmen, the world can never 
have too many gifted healers.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0090(0),My thinkin' exactly.,
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0100(0),"That's why I need to keep gettin' better, so I can 
help as many folks as I can.",
TX_PC_BAL_0101A0_0110(0),A noble ambition.,
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0000(0),"You are devoted to your studies, indeed. Most 
admirable.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0010(0),"I've got lots to learn still, is why.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0020(0),"Even if I spend every free moment with my 
nose in the books, it's never enough.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0030(0),"Not if I want to be able to treat every injury or 
illness I come across.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0040(0),"With your passion, I do not doubt you will one 
day achieve that.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0050(0),"More than knowledge itself, it is drive and 
dedication that make someone the best they can 
be.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0060(0),"You already have the most important thing you 
need for learning.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0070(0),"You think so? Can't say it ever felt that way to 
me.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0080(0),"Keep up the work, and you will become the 
apothecary you always wanted to be.",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0090(0),"I can't help but feel like you're being overly 
generous there, Professor...",
TX_PC_BAL_0102A0_0100(0),"But if you have that much faith in me, maybe I 
should, too!",
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0000(0),"It's beautiful, that shell.",
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0010(0),"Ain't it, though? Ellen's got a heart of gold.",
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0020(0),I'll say! Mind if I take a closer look?,
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0030(0),...?,
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0040(0),This shell...,
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0050(0),"You're thinking it may be something rare? 
Valuable, even?",
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0060(0),"Let's see now... Why, yes, I'm sure of it! This 
shell...",
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0070(0),The shell...?,
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0080(0),...Is utterly ordinary.,
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0090(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0100(0),"...In terms of value, at least. But Ellen gave it to 
you with all the gratitude in her heart.",
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0110(0),"And that means there's no treasure like it in all 
the world!",
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0120(0),"Hahaha! I see what you did there... But thank 
you, Tress.",
TX_PC_BAL_0103A0_0130(0),"So don't lose it, now, you hear?",
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0000(0),"Alfyn, sir. I wish to thank you.",
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0010(0),You do? For what?,
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0020(0),For healing Flynn.,
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0030(0),"I don't need thanks for that, Ophilia.",
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0040(0),"Easing folk's suffering is my job. I'm just doing 
what I came here to do.",
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0050(0),"Only because you are a gentle soul, and have 
<span style=""italic"">made</> it your job. That's a rare thing in this day 
and age.",
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0060(0),"Aw, shucks.",
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0070(0),You're gonna set the ants on me now.,
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0080(0),...I beg your pardon?,
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0090(0),"My behind. It gets mighty itchy any time 
someone starts singin' my praises...",
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0100(0),"How, uh...dreadful.",
TX_PC_BAL_010500_0110(0),"Tell me about it. It wouldn't be half as bad if I 
could just...stop...scratching...",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0000(0),...What do you intend to do about that woman?,
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0010(0),"Vanessa? I reckon I'll let her stew in gaol and 
ponder all she's done.",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0020(0),"Gaol or no, she doesn't strike me as the type to 
turn introspective...",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0030(0),"Maybe, maybe not. But I figure she's tossing and 
turning somethin' fierce right about now.",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0040(0),...What do you mean?,
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0050(0),"See, slumberthorn has other effects, less well 
known. It can prick a person's conscience, for 
example.",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0060(0),"If there's somethin' in your heart you'd rather 
avoid, it'll come out in your sleep instead...",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0070(0),...As a nightmare.,
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0080(0),"That's right. How she'll deal with that when she 
wakes up is up to her.",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0090(0),"But I warrant she <span style=""italic"">is</> having second thoughts 
about what she did.",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0100(0),"...Well, I hope so.",
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0110(0),Why? For my sake?,
TX_PC_BAL_010700_0120(0),...Just be careful. All right?,
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0010(0),"Alfyn, are you crying?",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0020(0),"What? N-naw, of course not... I just—
I have something in my eye...",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0030(0),"S-sweat, that is! My eyes get sweaty and... No, I 
mean, a bit of dust! In my eyes! Both of them!",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0040(0),"...Alfyn. There's no shame in showing your 
emotions.",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0050(0),"Those little ones adored you, after all.",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0060(0),"You'll be a wonderful father someday, I'm sure 
of that.",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0070(0),F-father...!?,
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0080(0),"Now do look after those shells, won't you?",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0090(0),"Oh, er...right.",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0100(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0110(0),"Aw, shucks. Another speck of dust...",
TX_PC_BAL_010900_0120(0),Oh dear...,
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0000(0),"Why, I never!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0010(0),How can he just leave that poor man to die!?,
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0020(0),You can say that again!,
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0030(0),"A man who turns his back on the sick and 
suffering has no right to call himself an 
apothecary!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0040(0),If only more people could be like you!,
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0050(0),"You know, we merchants have a saying...",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0060(0),"""When you help a traveler in need, accept no 
coin in return.""",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0070(0),...Huh?,
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0080(0),"Not even merchants set a price when it comes 
to helping people in trouble.",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0090(0),"Well, I'll be. You merchants are more charitable 
than you let on.",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0100(0),"So if you're ever in need, you know where to 
find me!",
TX_PC_BAL_020000_0110(0),"Heh, much appreciated.",
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0000(0),"Perhaps I could take care of Miguel in your 
stead...?",
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0010(0),That won't be necessary now.,
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0020(0),"He still needs rest, but the danger's passed. He's 
in no more need of nursing.",
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0030(0),I'm relieved to hear that. But still...,
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0040(0),"He suffered such grievous wounds. Did he not 
have anyone to look after him?",
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0050(0),"I couldn't say. Certain he should've seen an 
apothecary sooner than he did.",
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0060(0),"Well, he was blessed indeed that you arrived 
when you did.",
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0070(0),"(Guided by the Flame, eh? Heh, a toast or two'll 
be in order once he wakes up.)",
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0080(0),Come to think of it...,

consume ale or spirits...",
TX_PC_BAL_020100_0100(0),"Ack! R-right, of course...!",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0000(0),Headed for the alehouse?,
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0010(0),"Nothing like a flagon of mead to ease a man's 
cares!",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0020(0),"I'm a regular at more than a few alehouses. 
Though I go for the rumors more than the drink.",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0030(0),"Rumors? What has anyone in an alehouse to say 
that'd interest a man like you?",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0040(0),"Who's wealthy, for example, and who's not. 
Which lords pay their guards well, and which 
don't...",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0050(0),You can find all that out at the tavern?,
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0060(0),"That and more. Mead loosens tongues and gets 
men talking.",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0070(0),"There's quite some profit to be had in an 
alehouse, if you know how to listen.",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0080(0),"Not to mention, thieves themselves often drop 
by to share secrets and tips.",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0090(0),"Yikes, I'd best be careful next time I'm quenching 
my thirst.",
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0100(0),Heh... You can try.,
TX_PC_BAL_A20100_0110(0),"Either way, I'll be countin' my mugs if you and I 
ever go drinking!",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0000(0),"I'm not going to give up that easy, that's for 
sure!",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0010(0),"Now, now... Calm yourself there, friend.",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0020(0),"The boy was saved. That's no small solace, yes?",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0030(0),"I'm not saying it isn't, but still—!",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0040(0),"As an apothecary yourself, you are well 
equipped to see the extent of his wisdom and 
skill...",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0050(0),Damn right I am!,
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0060(0),"It's much the same in my own profession. I 
have had the honor of studying under many 
great thinkers.",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0070(0),"Scholars of such perspicacity and knowledge 
that I wondered if I could ever hope to be their 
equal.",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0080(0),...You don't say.,
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0090(0),"...Tell me. What precisely went through your 
mind when you realized the full extent of his 
apothecarial skills?",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0100(0),"My first thought was, ""Wow, he's just somethin' 
else."" But then I thought, ""Don't just sit there 
admirin', Alf!""",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0110(0),"I have to get as good as him so I can ease that 
many more people's pain!",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0120(0),"Oho! Now there's a splendid answer if I ever 
heard one.",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0130(0),"Guess I should stop mopin', and get to learnin'!",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0140(0),Now that's the spirit!,
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0150(0),"(I daresay that passion will carry him a long 
way.)",
TX_PC_BAL_020200_0160(0),"(Yes, he's found his path, and I can tell he won't 
be swayed from it...)",
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0010(0),"What's the matter, Primrose?",
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0020(0),"That apothecary, Ogen...",
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0030(0),His eyes are just like mine.,
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0040(0),"Are you kidding me? Yours are a hundred times 
more stunning, if you don't mind me sayin'!",
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0050(0),"Er...thank you. But that wasn't <span style=""italic"">quite</> what I 
meant.",
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0060(0),"You see, in my work, I've met the gaze of many 
a man...",
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0070(0),"And I've learned their eyes speak more truth 
than their tongues.",
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0080(0),"...You don't say. So, what did Ogen's eyes say to 
you?",
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0090(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_0203B0_0100(0),...That his heart is filled with pain.,
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0000(0),Now where did Miguel head off to?,
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0010(0),I knowe not.,
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0020(0),"But it is clear his wounds haven healed such 
that he might goen wandering.",
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0030(0),"...Yeah. That's a relief, at least.",
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0040(0),Thou art a skilled healer.,
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0050(0),Whoa! What's with the praise all of a sudden?,
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0060(0),"In but a brief time, thou didst curen that man's 
injuries so that he was able to risen from his 
sickbed.",
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0070(0),It is clear thou art a master of thy craft.,
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0080(0),"N-now, easy on the flowery words there. 
You're makin' me blush.",
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0090(0),"Thou art quickly made shy when the talk 
turneth to thyself.",
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0100(0),"My praise is not lightly offered. Thou wouldst 
do well to taken it to heart.",
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0110(0),"Aw, shucks... It <span style=""italic"">does</> mean a lot to me. But still, 
it's not over yet.",
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0120(0),"The healin', I mean. My work isn't done until 
Miguel is his old self again. Then you can 
shower me with praise all you want.",
TX_PC_BAL_0204A0_0130(0),Very well. Then so I shalle doen.,
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0000(0),Gods damn it all!,
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0010(0),"Steady now, Alfyn.",
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0020(0),"""Steady now""!? I trusted him, that brazen-faced 
brute...!",
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0030(0),"I say again, steady, my friend. Our first priority 
is the child.",
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0040(0),Am I not right?,
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0050(0),...You are.,
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0060(0),"...Sorry. Sometimes my emotions get the better 
of me.",
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0070(0),"You need not be sorry. In times like this, we 
must help one another.",
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0080(0),"I have no doubt that one day, it will be my turn 
to call upon you for wisdom and perspective.",
TX_PC_BAL_0205A0_0090(0),Fair enough...and thanks.,
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0010(0),"Say, Alfyn?",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0020(0),"What is it, Tress? I'm feelin' a bit tired, truth be 
told.",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0030(0),And my back is killing me...,
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0040(0),...,
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0050(0),"(Alfyn looks like he's feeling down. I guess I 
should say something...)",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0060(0),"As long as you're around, you'll cure any illness 
I get, right?",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0070(0),Right.,
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0080(0),"Because you always brew the best medicine 
you possibly can, right?",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0090(0),Darn right.,
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0100(0),"But your potions are still nothing compared to 
Ogen's, right?",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0110(0),"You got that—hey, wait a minute.",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0120(0),"What's that supposed mean? I'd pit my cures 
against his, any day of the week!",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0130(0),"I'll show you who's the top apothecary around 
here. Just you watch!",
TX_PC_BAL_0300B0_0140(0),(Hehe... Too easy.),
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0000(0),"You've been most industrious, my young friend.",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0010(0),"Naw. I've worked harder days, trust me.",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0020(0),"Is that so? Still, pray allow me to buy you a 
flagon of mead for your efforts.",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0030(0),"Oho, didn't see that coming!",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0040(0),"Never figured you scholar types went in for the 
drink. Dulling of the senses and all that.",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0050(0),"I am not opposed to the occasional libation, 
when enjoyed in moderation.",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0060(0),"Uh-huh. You don't strike me as the type who'd 
ever get drunk.",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0070(0),"It's all about knowing when to say when, friend. 
And besides, I hold my spirits rather well.",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0080(0),"You don't say? Maybe we should sit down one 
night and have it out. Match each other mug for 
mug.",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0090(0),"An intriguing challenge. And we could make it 
even more interesting with a little wager...",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0100(0),Right! Loser pays for the both of us!,
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0110(0),"(...Ah, good. That seems to have cheered him up 
a little.)",
TX_PC_BAL_A300B0_0120(0),"(And truth be told, it has been a while since I last 
paid a visit to the alehouse. It might do me good, 
as well...)",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0000(0),"I must say, Alfyn...",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0010(0),"You seemed to be enjoying yourself at the 
alehouse yesterday.",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0020(0),"Heh, yeah! Me and mead get along just fine.",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0030(0),"I could tell, the number of times I had to fill your 
mug. You should thank me, you know.",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0040(0),Ahaha! I suppose I should.,
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0050(0),"But you could have poured Ogen a drink from 
time to time, too.",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0060(0),The man seemed to prefer his own company.,
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0070(0),"Ah, don't worry. He's just an old grump, anyway.",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0080(0),"But I figure he'd cheer up quick if you showed 
him a dance or two.",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0090(0),...Hm?,
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0100(0),"There's real magic in the way you move on 
stage. It'd brighten anyone's day.",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0110(0),"A smooth talker, are we?",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0120(0),"Hey, it ain't just talk! I'm telling you, I bet even 
Ogen wouldn't be able to tear his eyes away.",
TX_PC_BAL_0301B0_0130(0),"Heh. Then maybe I <span style=""italic"">will</> pour him a drink next 
time.",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0000(0),Alfyn! I've drawn you a bath!,
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0010(0),"Aw, thanks! That's mighty kind of you.",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0020(0),Do let me know if there is anything else I can do.,
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0030(0),"I appreciate it. Really, I do.",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0040(0),"But don't wear yourself out on my account, 
y'hear?",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0050(0),"It does no one any good if you work yourself 
sick tryin' to take care of someone else.",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0060(0),"Oh, don't worry about me. I can take care of 
myself, you know.",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0070(0),"You've got a good heart, Ophilia. Like no one I've 
ever met.",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0080(0),"Have you ever thought of becoming an 
apothecary? It's high time I took on an 
apprentice...",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0090(0),Really? And you're asking me?,
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0100(0),"Why, that would be wonderful! Of course I'd...",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0110(0),"...But what am I saying? I couldn't abandon my 
priestly duties. I swore an oath, you see, and...",
TX_PC_BAL_030200_0120(0),"Hahaha! I'm only jokin'! You already have your 
trade—though I'm pleased to know you have 
even a passin' interest in mine.",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0000(0),...But I wonder why...,
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0010(0),"That man's face was the face of one who had 
given up all hope.",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0020(0),"Had he lost his reason to live? Was he so 
tortured by the sins of his past?",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0030(0),"Either way, it's a darn fool that lives life as if he 
wants it to end.",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0040(0),...Just so.,
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0050(0),"But it would behoove us to learn what makes 
him act in such a manner.",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0060(0),"If there is anything I might do, do not hesitate to 
ask.",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0070(0),"I won't. You're a good man to talk to when 
things are botherin' me and my blood is up.",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0080(0),"Whenever you need my ear, you need only say 
the word.",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0090(0),"Thanks, Olberic. It's good havin' you around.",
TX_PC_BAL_A30200_0100(0),"(I can't very well leave things alone. After all, 
that man...)",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0000(0),"Well, you're looking more chipper.",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0010(0),...Huh?,
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0020(0),"You were moping around like a stick in the mud 
for a while there.",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0030(0),"Is that right? Guess we can put that down to 
the encouragement of an old pal.",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0040(0),Old pal?,
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0050(0),"Yeah. Found a letter, tucked away in my satchel. 
You'd think after all these years he could just 
say it to my face...",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0060(0),"Well, it sounds like you got yourself a good 
friend.",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0070(0),"Heh, you got that right!",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0080(0),"Would you trust this friend of yours forever? 
No matter what?",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0090(0),Darn right I would!,
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0100(0),...Even if he betrayed you?,
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0110(0),"Yep. Because if he <span style=""italic"">did</> betray me, it'd be 
because he didn't have any other choice.",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0120(0),"Like his little sister begged him to steal my 
sleepweed...with tears in her eyes, or somethin' 
like that.",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0130(0),"Folk make mistakes sometimes—no point in 
throwing away a whole friendship over that!",
TX_PC_BAL_0304B0_0140(0),"...Heh. You're a bigger man than I gave you 
credit for.",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0000(0),So thou owest this man a debt.,
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0010(0),"Yeah. He's the whole reason I became an 
apothecary.",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0020(0),I see... So he is like a master to thee.,
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0030(0),"You have a master, too, right? What's he to you?",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0040(0),Well...,
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0050(0),"He raisede me like a father. And he is the hunter 
I strive to ben.",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0060(0),"Ah, a role model. Yeah. That's how I think about 
my ""master"" too.",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0070(0),"I reckon if we both work hard enough, we 
could end up even better than our masters 
someday!",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0080(0),Better!?,
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0090(0),"I...I hadde not imaginede such a thing even 
possible.",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0100(0),"Why not? If you're trying to be as good as 
someone, you might as well strive to be better.",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0110(0),"Then you can stand in front of them, all proud 
like, and tell him...",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0120(0),"""Now the student has become the master...and 
it's all thanks to you!"" Not bad, right?",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0130(0),"Indeed. Thou speakest wisdom. So let us striven 
together.",
TX_PC_BAL_0306F0_0140(0),Now that's the spirit!,
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0000(0),So you know that woman?,
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0010(0),"Yes, from when I was still living a noble's life. It's 
been ten years since we last saw each other.",
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0020(0),That's quite a long time.,
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0030(0),"I am glad to see her safe. I tried to find out 
where she had gone, but to no avail.",
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0040(0),I'm so sorry about what happened...to you both.,
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0050(0),You needn't be.,
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0060(0),"After all, I'm sure you've had more than your 
fair share of hardships, too.",
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0080(0),"Yet here we are, traveling together and putting 
the past behind us.",
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0090(0),"We should be rejoicing, not feeling sorry for 
each other.",
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0100(0),"(Primrose is so strong. Stronger than I'll ever 
be...)",
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0110(0),"I'm glad I can make this journey with you. I feel 
all the braver for knowing you.",
TX_PC_SHA_010100_0120(0),Good to hear!,
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0000(0),"Hey, Primrose? What's a brothel?",
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0010(0),"I tried to ask Arianna, but she just hemmed and 
hawed and then wandered off...",
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0030(0),"Tressa, there are just some things that children 
shouldn't know...",
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0040(0),"Oh, come on! This is getting annoying—someone 
just tell me!",
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0050(0),"...And I'm not a child, by the way.",
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0060(0),If you insist. Lean in closer and I'll whisper it...,
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0080(0),...!,
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0090(0),Hehe. Do you get it now?,
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0100(0),"Er, Tressa? Your mouth is hanging agape...",
TX_PC_SHA_010200_0110(0),"Oh, er, sorry! I forgot it was still open...",
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0010(0),Hm?,
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0030(0),"Alfyn, what's the matter? You can't seem to 
stand still.",
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0040(0),"...Huh? Oh shucks, sorry. It's just it's so cold up 
here...",
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0050(0),"I was born in the south, and me and the cold, 
we don't get along too well.",
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0060(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0070(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0080(0),"You're thinking about the brothel, aren't you?",
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0090(0),...!,
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0100(0),Thought so.,
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0110(0),"S-sorry. It's just the thought of all those 
beautiful women...and mugs of mead...",
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0120(0),"You'd do better to keep your mind on the 
journey. Besides...",
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0130(0),"You don't need a brothel if all you want is the 
company of a beautiful woman.",
TX_PC_SHA_A10200_0140(0),R-right...,
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0000(0),You dance beautifully.,
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0010(0),Thank you.,
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0020(0),"You were positively inspiring. I wish I could 
dance like that, but alas...",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0030(0),"Hehe. Two left feet, right?",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0040(0),"I'm afraid so. I dared not go to the faculty balls 
for fear I'd trip over some poor girl and make a 
fool of us both.",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0050(0),"I wonder if lessons would help. Or should I 
simply accept who I am and stick to my tomes?",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0060(0),"Well, you're probably a quick learner. And even 
the clumsiest people can manage the basic 
steps...",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0070(0),"The most important thing is to enjoy the dance, 
and let yourself go.",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0080(0),"Right, right. Don't be self-conscious. Of course 
that makes sense.",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0090(0),"It would be rather wonderful to do all those 
complicated steps and not think about it...",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0100(0),"As much as I love scholarship, I love dancing, too.",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0110(0),"Well, if you're <span style=""italic"">that</> eager, I could give you some 
pointers.",
TX_PC_SHA_0103A0_0120(0),"You'd do that!? Why, I would be most grateful if 
you could!",

TX_PC_SHA_010500_0010(0),Why so grim?,
TX_PC_SHA_010500_0020(0),Grim?,
TX_PC_SHA_010500_0030(0),You look like a tiger about to pounce on its prey.,
TX_PC_SHA_010500_0040(0),"...Maybe I am. I've been hunting for a long time 
now.",
TX_PC_SHA_010500_0050(0),"Well, just make sure the hunter doesn't become 
the hunted.",
TX_PC_SHA_010500_0060(0),Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing.,

you cared so much...",

that motto, you need only ask.",

your service.",

TX_PC_SHA_A10500_0060(0),"Having you nearby already gives me courage 
enough.",

nothing will stop me.",
TX_PC_SHA_A10500_0080(0),"I hope that I might also call on your help, should 
the need arise.",
TX_PC_SHA_A10500_0090(0),Of course. Whenever you need me.,
TX_PC_SHA_010900_0000(0),"Primrose, I wolde asken thee about that dagger...",
TX_PC_SHA_010900_0010(0),...It was a gift from my father.,

because—",
TX_PC_SHA_010900_0030(0),"Of those two rings, hanging from your necklace?",
TX_PC_SHA_010900_0040(0),"Indeed. They aren the only thing I have left from 
my parents.",
TX_PC_SHA_010900_0050(0),"I have no memories of them, for they died 
when I was but an infant.",

TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0010(0),So this is where you were born and raised.,
TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0020(0),"It is. Though much has changed in the last ten 
years. The people, the town...",
TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0030(0),"It seems like this lord we've been told about has 
a lot to do with that.",
TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0040(0),"Yes. And none of the changes have been for the 
better.",
TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0050(0),This was a happier place when I knew it.,
TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0060(0),It was peaceful...and prosperous.,
TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0070(0),"My father was a strict man, but he was 
respected and loved by the people.",

I was of where we lived...",
TX_PC_SHA_0200B0_0100(0),"Oh, Primrose...",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0000(0),So who's this Simeon guy?,
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0010(0),Well...,
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0020(0),Was he...someone really special to you?,
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0030(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0040(0),"Tressa, have you ever felt a special kinship to 
someone?",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0050(0),"A special kinship? You mean, like, aside from my 
family?",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0060(0),"I guess I never really thought about it. Trading's 
been my life since before I can remember.",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0070(0),"I kind of feel a connection with my customers 
when we make a good deal. Is that the same 
thing?",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0080(0),"...Let me tell you something, Tressa.",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0090(0),"When something about a person resonates deep 
within you, it's the most wonderful feeling.",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0100(0),"Your heart is freed, your mind is opened...",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0110(0),"And you realize there's more to the world than 
you ever knew.",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0120(0),"But I wouldn't expect you to understand. After 
all, you're still a little girl.",
TX_PC_SHA_0202B0_0130(0),Hey! Who are you calling little!?,
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0000(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0010(0),May I be so bold as to pry?,
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0020(0),...Huh?,
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0030(0),"That man is very important to you, is he not?",
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0040(0),Why do you say that?,
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0050(0),"'Tis a conjecture, based on how you both look 
at each other.",
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0060(0),"Had you not chosen to live your life the way 
you do, I wonder if—",
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0070(0),"You can stop right there, Professor.",
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0080(0),"How I live my life is my affair, not yours.",
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0090(0),"Y-yes, quite. I do apologize.",
TX_PC_SHA_A202B0_0100(0),"(...I'd best be careful around him. He's sharper 
than he looks.)",
TX_PC_SHA_020300_0000(0),"He was thy beloved father. Shalt thou not

TX_PC_SHA_020300_0010(0),...No. Not yet.,

TX_PC_SHA_020300_0040(0),Only then will I go. To tell him what I have done.,
TX_PC_SHA_020300_0050(0),"If that is thy wish, then so be it.",
TX_PC_SHA_020300_0060(0),"But thank you, anyway. For caring.",
TX_PC_SHA_020300_0070(0),"I <span style=""italic"">will</> return, sooner rather than later. But right 
now, I have work to do.",
TX_PC_SHA_020300_0080(0),Your strength is to be admired.,
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0000(0),Honor...,
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0010(0),"Tell me, Olberic. What does honor mean to you?",
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0020(0),A simple question. But one with no easy answer.,
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0030(0),"For me, it is using my blade to protect others. 
There is naught else I can offer.",
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0040(0),"Sometimes I think you're too humble for your 
own good...",
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0050(0),"No matter how lofty our aspirations, in the end, 
we can only do what we are capable of.",
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0060(0),"Better then to make ourselves the best that we 
can be, than dream in vain of saintliness.",
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0070(0),Well said.,
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0080(0),"That's what I'm trying to do. Improve myself, so 
I can do more...",
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0090(0),"Especially since I met you. You're a true 
inspiration, you know.",
TX_PC_SHA_0204A0_0100(0),"Egads, I hope I'm not blushing again...",
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0000(0),Time for some breaking and entering.,
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0010(0),Indeed...,
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0020(0),Think you can pull it off?,
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0030(0),Therion...,

TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0060(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0070(0),"I've thought about giving up more than once. 
I've wondered what sort of life I could live if I 
chose a different path.",
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0080(0),"But each time I do...I can't imagine what the 
future would look like. This is all I know.",
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0090(0),If you say so.,
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0100(0),"So if you're trying to talk me out of avenging 
my father—",
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0110(0),That's not it.,
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0120(0),"I just know how easy it is to screw things up if 
you don't stay calm.",
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0130(0),"So don't go losing your head in there, okay?",
TX_PC_SHA_0205A0_0140(0),"Stay calm... I'll remember that. Thank you, 
Therion.",
TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0000(0),"Hey, Primrose?",
TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0010(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0020(0),This is for you.,
TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0030(0),...Medicine?,

TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0050(0),Thank you...,
TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0060(0),"Listen... I want you to take care of yourself, 
okay?",
TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0070(0),I'm askin' as your apothecary...and friend.,
TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0080(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_0208A0_0090(0),"Thank you, Alfyn...",
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0000(0),How're you holding up?,
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0010(0),I'm fine. I can handle him.,
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0020(0),If you say so.,
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0030(0),"But that man's not just wicked—he's cunning, 
too.",
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0040(0),"There's no telling what tricks he'll try to pull. 
Better be ready for anything.",
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0050(0),Thanks for the advice. I'll watch out.,
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0060(0),Heh...,
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0070(0),What?,
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0080(0),It just occurred to me...,
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0090(0),"I never thought that having companions would 
actually give me courage.",
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0100(0),"Courage is all well and good, but so is vigilance. 
Don't let your guard down.",
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0110(0),"I don't intend to. I look forward to seeing what 
you can do as well.",
TX_PC_SHA_030000_0120(0),Heh... I'll be sure to give you a show.,
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0000(0),"Well, this is quite the mystery.",
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0010(0),"What is, Professor?",
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0020(0),"I'm puzzled as to why there is a theater here, 
of all places.",
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0030(0),"They took it upon themselves to refurbish an 
old castle.",
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0040(0),"But I just can't fathom <span style=""italic"">why</>. All that time and 
effort...",
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0050(0),Does it matter?,
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0060(0),"At this point, I don't think we should be 
surprised by anything they do.",
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0070(0),If you say so.,
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0080(0),"In any case, we are in enemy territory now. We 
must proceed with caution.",
TX_PC_SHA_A30000_0090(0),"Certainly. Don't you fret about that, Professor.",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0000(0),"I swear, who does that Simeon oaf think he is!?",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0010(0),Playing with someone's heart like that...,
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0020(0),...,
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0030(0),"Well, I won't let him get away with it! You have 
my full support, Primrose!",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0040(0),"I appreciate it. But listen, Tressa...",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0050(0),Hm?,
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0060(0),"I'm sure you'll find the right man someday. So 
please, don't give up.",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0070(0),"What? No, wait! I wasn't—!",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0080(0),"After all, not only are you pretty, but you've got 
a personality to match.",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0090(0),"Why, if I were a man, I'd marry you in a 
heartbeat.",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0100(0),"H-hey, I was being serious!",
TX_PC_SHA_0302A0_0110(0),"Hehe. Sorry, I couldn't resist.",
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0000(0),"So this character's story, in the play...",
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0010(0),It's mine. In nearly every detail.,
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0020(0),Just as I thought...,
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0030(0),What is this Simeon thinking?,
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0040(0),"Whatever it is, it's awful. Taking someone's 
memories and putting them up on the stage for 
all to see...",
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0050(0),"It is. But he's a fool if he thinks I'm going to play 
by his script.",
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0060(0),He won't get his way.,
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0070(0),"Good. And I'm going to be right by your side to 
make sure of it.",
TX_PC_SHA_A302A0_0080(0),"Thank you, Ophilia.",

TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0010(0),Huh?,
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0020(0),"You are as pale as a ghost. Are you sure you 
can continue?",
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0030(0),"Of course. ...Besides, I have no choice. My path 
leads only forward.",
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0040(0),"I can look back at the past—but there's no 
returning to it.",
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0050(0),"No matter how happy, how sweet a time it 
was...",
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0060(0),"Onward I must press, and honor the words that 
my father left me.",
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0070(0),"""Faith shall be your shield.""",
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0080(0),That's right.,
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0090(0),"If you are so resolved, then I shall be honored 
to march with you.",
TX_PC_SHA_0303B0_0100(0),Know that I pledge my blade to your cause.,

TX_PC_SHA_0304C0_0020(0),"Oh, I'm not fooling you, am I? Is it so obvious?",
TX_PC_SHA_0304C0_0030(0),Aye. I understande thy feelings.,
